Lecture3 – Biology (Notothenioids) 

Narrator 
Listen to part of a lecture in a biology class. 

Professor 
Ways in which animals adapt to their environment are often *quite* *ingenious* actually. And as an example of this, let me tell you about a fish, a group of fish known as the Notothenioids. There’s over 90 known species of Notothenioids and they inhabit both shallow and very deep waters, mostly around Antarctica. Many are fairly small, though the largest species can weigh up to 150 kilograms. 

Notothenioids can be identified by their large eyes, which are covered by a thick insulating layer of clear tissue. This tissue protects their eyes from freezing. Remember, the freezing point of ocean water, salt water, is lower than for fresh water, negative 1.9 degree Celsius (-1.9°C). So it can get a lot colder for fish in an ocean, say, than in a river or lake. So this means that the ocean waters around Antarctica are cold enough to freeze most types of fish, but Notothenioids don’t freeze. In fact, they *thrive*. They account for some 95% of all fish in the southern ocean, the ocean that surrounds Antarctica. 

So, how unusual is that? To have a single family of fish dominating an entire ocean. I mean, think of…say, tropical or temperate marine environments, which have incredibly diverse fish populations. Coral reefs, for example, support over 4000 types of fish, along with sponges, crustaceans, and many other organisms. 
So, exactly when and how did the Notothenioids come to dominate the southern ocean? 

Well, around 30 million years ago, the waters around Antarctica were a lot warmer than they are today. Um...at that time, Antarctica was connected to South America, which means that warm air from the north could flow southward and heat up the Antarctica waters. Because the water around Antarctica then was relatively warm, it supported many types of fish. And we know this from fossil evidence. 
But the 90 *or so* species of Notothenioids that exist today didn’t exist at all back then. In fact, only one ancestral Notothenioid species existed. But somewhere between 5 million and 14 million years ago, two major changes took place. 

First, what we call a chance *mutation*. A tiny genetic change occurred in that one Notothenioid species. Its DNA allowed for the production of a special protein, a protein that prevents the fish from freezing. The way this…this anti-freeze protein works is: it binds to any ice crystals that form inside the fish. This binding action prevents the ice crystals from growing larger. And this is what prevents Notothenioids from freezing. 

Now, at that time, the waters the Notothenioids inhabited were still not freezing cold, so the protein didn’t really make a difference as far as the fish’s survival. But this would change, because in the same period of geologic time there was a shift in the earth’s continental plates. Continental drift caused Antarctica to move apart from the *landmass* of South America and to drift into the Southern Polar Region. This resulted in a powerful water current *encircling* *Antarctica*, which prevented the Antarctic waters from mixing with warmer water. So the southern ocean, isolated from that warm airflow from the north, cooled down drastically, to the kinds of *sub-freezing temperatures* we associate with it today. 

Now, most fish species couldn’t survive in this *frigid* environment and they became extinct. But that one Notothenioid species, with its unique ability to produce that anti-freeze protein, thrived. It had *virtually* the entire southern ocean to itself! 

So? Well, there was little or no competition for food or space. You might think of it as…um…as a…a kind of ecological vacuum. And the Notothenioids exploited fully. The species migrated into different habitats throughout the southern ocean. And its population increased dramatically, with various sub-populations migrating into different parts of the ocean. Over time these sub-populations in all those different habitats…well, they developed very different physical traits. They adapted to survive in their particular *ecological niche*, their…their position within a particular ecosystem. 

We call this type of species *diversification* within a species adaptive radiation. And what adaptive radiation is is: an evolutionary process by which a parent species rapidly undergoes changes resulting in various new species in order to fill multiple ecological niches. So in the case of the Notothenioids, that single species started colonizing empty habitats to such an extent that it evolved into a broad range of new species, the 90 or so Notothenioid species that we have today. So let me switch to adaptive radiation with regard to another species that’s also been very successful.

Right : B	Chose : B


#### TPO_033_L005_Q002
Why does the professor mention that coral reefs support more than 4,000 species of fish?
- To find out what students know about tropical fish
- To contrast two types of ocean environments
- To imply that there may be species in the Southern Ocean that have not been discovered yet
- To imply that there may be fossil evidence of coral reefs in the Southern Ocean
Right : B	Chose : B


#### TPO_033_L005_Q003
What characteristic of notothenioids helps them survive in subfreezing temperatures?
- They maintain an unusually high body temperature.
- A special tissue in their eyes enables them to see through ice.
- Special proteins make their blood circulate too fast to freeze.
- Ice crystals in their bodies are prevented from growing large enough to harm them.
Right : D	Chose : B


#### TPO_033_L005_Q004
Why did the antifreeze protein initially give no special advantage to the earliest notothenioids?
- Many other types of fish had the same protein.
- The notothenioids were not living in subfreezing temperatures.
- The effect of the antifreeze protein was neutralized by other proteins.
- The antifreeze protein functioned only in the smallest notothenioids.
Right : B	Chose : B


#### TPO_033_L005_Q005
According to the professor, what factors led to the rapid distribution of notothenioids throughout the Southern Ocean?
- A genetic mutation occurred in the DNA of the earliest notothenioid.
- There was an increase in competition for food in temperate waters.
- Antarctica broke off and drifted away from the South American continent.
- The waters around Antarctica temporarily warmed up.
Right : AC	Chose :  AC


#### TPO_033_L005_Q006
According to the professor, what happened to notothenioids that migrated to different areas of the Southern Ocean?
- They evolved into a wide variety of notothenioid species.
- They developed the ability to tolerate a wide range of temperatures.
- Some of them became extinct because of new predators.
- Some of them developed additional antifreeze proteins.
