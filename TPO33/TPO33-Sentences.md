Inversion, the reversal of the normal word order of a sentence (subject-verb-object), is used in English for several reasons, including emphasis, formality, and stylistic purposes. Here are some common situations where inversion is used:

### 1. Questions:

Inversion is used to form questions by placing the auxiliary verb before the subject.
- **Example**: "Are you coming to the party?"

### 2. Negative Adverbials:
When negative adverbials (such as "never," "rarely," "seldom," "hardly," "scarcely," "little," "not only," etc.) are placed at the beginning of a sentence for emphasis, inversion is required.
- **Example**: "Never have I seen such a beautiful sunset."
- **Example**: "Not only did he forget my birthday, but he also forgot our anniversary."

### 3. Conditional Sentences (Third Conditional):
In formal writing, inversion can be used instead of "if" in conditional sentences.
- **Example**: "Had I known, I would have called you." (instead of "If I had known, I would have called you.")

### 4. After Certain Expressions:
Inversion often follows expressions that include words like "so," "such," "nor," "neither."
- **Example**: "So beautiful was the landscape that we stopped to take pictures."
- **Example**: "Neither did he apologize nor did he explain his actions."

### 5. Inversion After “Here” and “There”:
When sentences begin with "here" or "there" followed by a verb of existence or motion, inversion is used.
- **Example**: "Here comes the bus."
- **Example**: "There goes my hero."

### 6. Formal/Poetic Style:
Inversion can be used in literary or poetic language to create a more formal or dramatic effect.
- **Example**: "Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth."

### 7. Emphasis in Descriptive Phrases:
To emphasize a particular part of the sentence, such as time, place, or manner.
- **Example**: "On the hill stood a lone oak tree."

### 8. Reporting Speech:
In reported speech, especially in more formal contexts, inversion is sometimes used.
- **Example**: "‘I will not give up,’ said he."

Using inversion effectively can add variety and emphasis to writing and speech, making it more engaging and dynamic.

#### With the increase in population and the development of centralized authority came the emergence of the cities.

In this sentence, the usual subject-verb order is inverted for stylistic reasons. In a standard sentence, the subject precedes the verb, but here, the verb "came" precedes the subject "the emergence of the cities." This inversion emphasizes the event or result ("the emergence of the cities") that follows the conditions described in the prepositional phrase.

- Standard Word Order:

  ​	"The emergence of the cities came with the increase in population and the development of centralized authority."
