### The Development of Social Complexity
For most of human history, we have *foraged* (hunted, fished, and collected wild plants) for food. Small nomadic groups could easily supply the necessities for their families. No one needed more, and providing for more than one’s needs *made little sense*. The organization of such societies could be rather simple, revolving around age and gender categories. Such societies likely were largely *egalitarian*; beyond distinctions based on age and gender, virtually all people had equivalent rights, status, and access to resources.

Archaeologist Donald Henry suggests that the combination of a rich habitat and *sedentism* (permanent, year-round settlement) led to a dramatic increase in human population. In his view, nomadic, simple foragers have relatively low levels of fertility. Their high-protein, low-carbohydrate diets result in low body-fat levels, which are commonly associated with low fertility in women. High levels of physical activity and long periods of nursing, which are common among modern simple foragers, probably also contributed to low levels of female fertility if they were likewise common among ancient foragers.

In Henry’s view, the *adoption* of a more settled existence in areas with abundant food resources would have contributed to higher fertility levels among the *sedentary* foragers. A diet higher in wild cereals produces *proportionally* more body fat, leading to higher fertility among women. Cereals, which are easy to digest, would have supplemented and then replaced mother’s milk as the primary food for older infants. Since women are less fertile when they are breast-feeding, substituting cereals for mother’s milk would have resulted in closer spacing of births and the potential for a greater number of live births for each woman. A more sedentary existence may also have lowered infant *mortality* and perhaps increased longevity among the aged. These more vulnerable members of society could safely stay in a fixed village rather than be forced regularly to move great distances as part of a nomadic existence, with its greater risk of accidents and trauma.

All of these factors may have resulted in a trend of increasing size among some local human populations in the Holocene (since 9600 B.C.E.). Given sufficient time, even in very rich habitats, human population size can reach carrying capacity, the maximum population an area can sustain within the context of a given subsistence system. And human population growth is like a runaway train: once it picks up speed, it is difficult to control. So even after reaching an area’s carrying capacity, Holocene human populations probably continued to grow in food-rich regions, overshooting the ability of the territory to feed the population, again within the context of the same subsistence strategy. In some areas, small changes in climate or minor changes in plant characteristics may have further destabilized local economies.

One possible response to *surpassing* the carrying capacity of a region is for a group to exploit adjoining land. However, good land may itself be limited—for example, to within the confines of a river valley.

Where neighbors are in the same position, having filled up the whole of the desirable habitat available in their home territories, expansion is also problematic. *Impinging* on the neighbors’ territory can lead to conflict, especially when they too are up against the capacity of the land to provide enough food.

Another option is to stay in the same area but to shift and intensify the food *quest* there. The *impulse* to produce more food to feed a growing population was satisfied in some areas by the development of more-complex subsistence strategies involving intensive labor and requiring more cooperation and greater coordination among the increasing numbers of people. This development resulted in a change in the social and economic equations that defined those societies. Hierarchies that did not exist in earlier foraging groups but that were helpful in structuring cooperative labor and in organizing more-complex technologies probably became established, even before domestication and agriculture, as pre-Neolithic societies (before the tenth millennium B.C.E.) reacted to the population increase.

Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.
- The appearance of domestication and agriculture brought about the need for more hierarchically organized systems of labor and technologies among pre-Neolithic foraging societies.

#### TPO_035_R002_Q014
As human societies in the pre-Neolithic period shifted from nomadic to sedentary lifestyles, their organization became more complex and hierarchical.
- The shift to sedentism did not occur in rich habitats, where groups were able to maintain nomadic, foraging lifestyles because of easy access to food sources.
- Changes in diet and activity associated with a sedentary life may have resulted in higher fertility levels and better chances of survival.
- In general, the higher the proportion of protein to carbohydrate in a female individual’s diet, the higher the level of that individual’s fertility.
- As human populations increased during the Holocene period, they began to exceed the number of people that could be sustained by the local environment.
- The carrying capacities of certain types of regions such as river valleys were limited by the presence of neighbors competing for the same resources.
- Societies responded to the limitations of their environment by developing more complex social and technological strategies that enabled them to produce more food within the same area.
