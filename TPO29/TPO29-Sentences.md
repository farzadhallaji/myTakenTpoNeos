  **Concept Explanation: Comparative Structure and Predicate Nominal**

  - **Comparative Structure:** This sentence uses a comparative structure "As [adjective] as" to compare two qualities. The first quality is "impressive" (referring to the quality of Roman pottery), and it is being compared to the second element, which is "its sheer massive quantity."
  - **Predicate Nominal:** A predicate nominal (or predicate noun) follows a linking verb (in this case, "is") and renames or provides more information about the subject. Here, "its sheer massive quantity" serves as the predicate nominal, providing information about the subject "the quality of Roman pottery."

  Let's break down how these elements work together:

  - The comparative structure "As impressive as" sets up a comparison between two things.
  - The subject of the sentence is "the quality of Roman pottery," which is described as "impressive."
  - The verb "is" links the subject to the predicate nominal.
  - The predicate nominal "its sheer massive quantity" describes the other part of the comparison, emphasizing the vast amount of Roman pottery in addition to its impressive quality.

  **Concept Explanation: Inverted Sentence Structure**
  - This sentence uses inversion, which is a structure where the auxiliary verb comes before the subject. This is often used for emphasis or in formal contexts. Here, "can" precedes "we" to emphasize the rarity of deriving real quantities.
