### Forest Fire Suppression

Forest fires have recently increased in intensity and extent in some forest types throughout the western United States. This recent increase in fires has resulted partly from climate change (the recent trend toward hot, dry summers) and partly from human activities, for complicated reasons that foresters came increasingly to understand about 30 years ago but whose relative importance is still debated. One factor is the direct effect of *logging*, which often turns a forest into something *approximating* a huge pile of *kindling* (wood for burning): the ground in a *logged forest* may remain covered with branches and treetops, left behind when the valuable trunks are *carted away*; a dense growth of new vegetation *springs up*, *further* increasing the forest’s fuel loads; and the trees logged and removed are of course the biggest and most fire-resistant individuals, leaving behind smaller and more flammable trees.

Another factor is that the United States Forest Service in the first decade of the 1900s *adopted* the policy of fire *suppression* (attempting to put out forest fires) for the obvious reason that it did not want valuable *timber* to go up in smoke, or people’s homes and lives to be threatened. The Forest Service’s announced goal became “*Put out* every forest fire by 10:00 A.M. on the morning after the day when it is first reported.” Firefighters became much more successful at achieving that goal after 1945, thanks to improved firefighting technology. For a few decades the amount of land burnt annually decreased by 80 percent. That happy situation began to change in the 1980s, due to the increasing frequency of large forest fires that were essentially impossible to *extinguish* unless rain and low winds combined to help. People began to realize that the United States federal government’s fire-suppression policy was contributing to those big fires and that natural fires caused by *lightning* had previously played an important role in maintaining forest structure.

The natural role of fire varies with altitude, tree species, and forest type. To take Montana’s low-altitude ponderosa pine forest as an example, historical records, plus counts of annual tree rings and *datable* fire *scars* on tree *stumps*, demonstrated that a ponderosa pine forest experiences a *lightning-lit fire* about once a decade under natural conditions (i.e., before fire suppression began around 1910 and became effective after 1945). The mature ponderosa trees have *bark* two inches thick and are relatively resistant to fire, which instead burns out the understory—the lower layer—of fire-sensitive Douglas *fir* *seedlings* that have grown up since the previous fire. But after only a decade’s growth until the next fire, those young seedling plants are still too low for fire to spread from them into the *crowns* of the ponderosa pine trees. *Hence* the fire remains confined to the ground and understory. As a result, many natural ponderosa pine forests have a parklike appearance, with low fuel loads, big trees spaced apart, and a relatively clear understory.

However, loggers concentrated on removing those big, old, valuable, fire-resistant ponderosa pines, while fire suppression for decades let the understory fill up with Douglas fir *saplings* that would in turn become valuable when full-grown. Tree densities increased from 30 to 200 trees per acre, the forest’s fuel load increased by a factor of 6, and the government repeatedly failed to *appropriate* money to thin out the saplings. When a fire finally does start in a sapling-*choked* forest, whether due to lightning or human carelessness or (*regrettably* often) intentional *arson*, the dense, tall saplings (young trees) may become a ladder that allows the fire to jump into the crowns of the trees. The outcome is sometimes an unstoppable *inferno*.

Foresters now identify the biggest problem in managing Western forests as what to do with those increased fuel loads that built up during the previous half century of effective fire suppression. In the wetter eastern United States, dead trees rot away more quickly than in the drier West, where more dead trees persist like giant *matchsticks*. In an ideal world, the Forest Service would manage and restore the forests, thin them out, and remove the dense understory by cutting or by controlled small fires. But no politician or voter wants to spend what it would cost to do that.

Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.
- Climate change caused by human activity is the main reason for the increase in fires over the past 30 years.

- For complicated reasons, over the past 30 years there has been an increase in the number of fires that take place during hot, dry summers.
- Both climate change and human activities are responsible for the recent increase in forest fires, although the contributions of those factors are still not agreed on.

All of the following are mentioned in paragraph 1 as consequences of logging that can promote forest fires EXCEPT:
- Fires are accidentally started by *logger*s.
- Pieces of flammable wood are left behind in the forest.
- There is a dense growth of new plants that act as fuel for fire.

What can be inferred from paragraph 2 about forest-fire suppression before 1900?
- It was more effective than afterward because there were fewer fires to suppress in most regions.
- There was no official program of forest-fire suppression in the United States.
- Forest-fire suppression was practiced more for the purpose of protecting homes than for protecting forests.
- The Forest Service had rules to control forest fires, but the rules were ignored.

Why does the author include the quotation “Put out every forest fire by 10:00 A.M. on the morning after the day when it is first reported”?
- To suggest that the Forest Service’s goals were unrealistic and ultimately unattainable
- To demonstrate how seriously the Forest Service took their responsibility of fire suppression
- To support the idea that fire-suppression techniques are most effective early in the day
- To provide an example of the new methods that resulted in successful firefighting after 1945

- Douglas fir saplings are expensive to maintain, leaving little government money for forest fire suppression.
- Saplings compete for space with the larger and more valuable fire-resistant trees.

For several reasons, forest fires have increased in number and intensity in the western United States.
- Fire suppression, which was initially thought to be beneficial, and logging are two human activities that have caused an increase in large forest fires.
- Logging is much less likely than other human activities to have effects that contribute to large forest fires.
- Because forest fires are dangerous to people’s property and a waste of valuable resources, the Forest Service currently has a policy to suppress all fires within a day.
- The biggest problem in Western forest management is the increased amount of fire fuel available in forests as a result of human activity.
- The Forest Service has not yet discovered exactly why the climate of western United States causes some types of trees but not others to catch fire.
- The United States government and the public are unwilling to cover the costs required to reduce the increased fuel loads in Western forests.
