### Also important is resolving power, a measure of the clarity of an image.

 there is an inversion where the typical subject-verb-complement order is reversed for emphasis. Normally, the sentence would be structured as "Resolving power is also important," with "resolving power" as the subject, "is" as the verb, and "also important" as the complement. In the inverted sentence, "Also important" comes first, followed by the verb "is," and the subject "resolving power" appears after the verb. This inversion highlights the importance of resolving power from the beginning of the sentence. The phrase "a measure of the clarity of an image" serves as an appositive, providing additional information about the subject "resolving power."
