Narrator:
Listen to a conversation between a student and his ecology professor.

Professor：
How is it going? Tom.

Student：
Great! I was, oh. I wanted to tell you. You know the guest speaker you brought into class last week from the wildlife conservation center.

Professor：
Susan Brown. Yes. She is an old friend from graduate school. 

Student：
Her talk on wildlife population modeling, well, it was very theoretical.

Professor：
It was certainly a change of pace from what we usually do. 

Student：
Yeah, but I think I pretty much followed along. Plus, I like to see people get so passionate about ecology, Oh, right. Ecology is your major field of study, isn't it? Yes, Susan Brown's certainly a *lively* speaker. What a shame she didn't go into teaching.

Student：
Uh, anyway, what I, well, a while ago, I saw this *blurb* in the school paper about an exchange program that’s part of the study abroad office. And today there was *booth* set up in the student center with a couple of students answering questions about the university's programs in foreign countries. Seeing the booth reminded me about the article in the paper and...

Professor：
Thinking about going abroad in the coming year?

Student：
Actually I just spent last summer studying in Tokyo. I think that *satisfied my urge* to travel.

Professor：
It must’ve been quite an experience.

Student：
Definitely. Taking all those language courses was really challenging. But what I wanted to find out at the booth was: it,s...um...a *domestic* exchange program, not studying abroad, but studying for a year somewhere else in the United State.

Professor：
I don't think I have heard of that.

Student：
Well, neither had the guys in the booth. They didn’t know what I was talking about. But when I talked to the supervisor in the study abroad office, it turns out we are part of a... a group of universities throughout the U.S that does a domestic exchange program. 

Professor：
Huh! So you spent...what...a year at another university and your classes count toward your degree here?

Student：
Yeah, and I paid the same fees, tuition, room and board, that I pay here. So it doesn't really cost any extra.

Professor：
Interesting.

Student：
And you know Tve lived here in southern Florida my whole life. And Tve always been interested in Montana. The university in Montana, where I want to go, has classes that deal specifically with the ecology there. Like I am interested in the greater yellow stone ecosystem. It is such an important ecosystem being the source of three major rivers, and I want to learn more about it.

Professor：
Wow! This is a unique idea. The climate, the plants and wildlife, it's really different from here, probably the culture too in a way, and don't forget about all the outdoor activities you could do there, hiking, skiing, and the national parks.

Student：
That's true. Anyway HI have to get my application together in the next month or so, and HI need two letters of recommendation, one from a professor in my major department.

Professor：
Consider it done.

Student：
Thanks.
