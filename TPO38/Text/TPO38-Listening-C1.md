Narrator:
Listen to a conversation between a student and an employee in the university housing office.

Employee:
Hi. Can I help you?

Student:
I hope so. I am taking a class this summer and I need to see about getting campus housing.

Employee:
Oh, sorry. I am afraid the deadline to apply for summer housing in the dormitories has already passed. I could help you look for something off campus.

Student:
Well, see, I only found out yesterday I need to take this course. It wasn't really my idea. I mean I was gonna take it in the fall. It is a course I need for my major in cognitive science, Professor Wilson was supposed to teach it but now...

Employee:
Oh, right. I heard he is *taking a last-minute leave of absence* next year. I hope everything is okay.

Student:
Oh yeah. He’ll be in Botswana helping develop the new cognitive science program at our sister university there. Anyway I have to take the course this summer if I want to graduate on time. Tve got a note from the dean approving the whole situation.

Employee:
Oh, well, in that case I guess we'd better make an exception for you. Only problem is most of the bedrooms are gone already. Was there any particular dorm you were interested in?

Student:
Well, Tm in Randolph Hall right now, but my roommate's graduating in May so I have signed up for a single in Murphy for the fall, room 206. I was hoping I might be able to just move in there now.

Employee:
Well, let's see what the computer says. Sorry, that room's scheduled for repainting and maintenance over the summer. So I can't give it to you.

Student:
I don't really care if it's repainted. HI be covering most of the walls with posters anyway. Couldn't I just take it as is?

Employee:
Sorry, no. It is actually a city *ordinance*. All rental rooms including dorm rooms have to be painted at least once every five years.

Student:
Oh, well, how about if I stay where Tm for the summer? Tm pretty sure they just painted it a couple years ago.

Employee:
Hang on, let me check. You said Randolph, right?

Student:
Room 122.

Employee:
Oops. Afraid not. The entire floor is taken.

Student:
Oh, well. Guess HI just have to move twice.

Employee:
One sec. I have got one more idea.Here we go. There is a room open in Murphy just down the hall from your new one. That way come fall, you'd only have to carry your things a few doors down.

Student:
Okay, works for me.

Employee:
Now, that room is a double. Right now you have got it to yourself but there's a chance someone else might sign up at the last minute, not likely. But you could end up with a roommate for the summer. Would that be okay?

Student:
Oh, sure. I can get along with anyone for a couple of months. 

Employee:
Okay, then, I will get the forms printed up. They should be ready for you by tomorrow afternoon. You can stop by and sign them then.

Student:
Excellent, thanks.
