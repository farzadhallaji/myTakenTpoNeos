Lecture3

Narrator:
Listen to part of the lecture in an environmental science class. Professor

When you try to imagine a *fungus*, you'd probably picture a mushroom popping up out of the ground. And think that’s it. But a fungus like that...most of it actually lives underground.

And *fungi* in general are often an important active component of the soil. A fungus secrets enzymes into the soil, enzymes that break down, decompose organic material in the soil. So the fungus can absorb this material and get nutrition.

But to me, what's most interesting about this process is how it may enable fungi to help clean up environmental pollution in the soil. And that's thanks in part to a substance in their cell walls called Chitin.

Now a lot of people think fungi are related to plants, but they are not. Believe it or not, the only other place chitin is found in abundance is in the exoskeletons of insects, crabs and such. So in this sense, fungi are more associated with insects than with any plant. Strange, huh? 

And the chitin in the cell walls of a *filamentous* fungus...a *filament*, of course, is a long thread-like structure, cells joined end to end. Filamentous fungi grow in soil and *in decaying* vegetation. And as their name implies they exist as filaments. And although regarded as microorganisms, filaments from a single fungus can fan out to occupy many square meters or even several square kilometers of forest floor. Their vast surface area allows them to break down and take in huge amounts of nutrients, but beyond that, the filaments also pull out of the soil a great deal of the pollution that might be in there, especially heavy metals.

And here is where chitin comes in, like some other substances in fungal cell walls, chitin forms strong chemical bonds to heavy metals in the environment, in a process we call *adsorption*.

Now, don't confuse this with *absorption*, where a substance is absorbed into a cell, into the interior of a cell. I mean, that is happening here too. But adsorption means binding to the outer surface of the cell. And a filamentous fungus can adsorb toxic heavy metals, bind them to the surface of its enormous network of filaments, and thereby detoxify a large soil ecosystem. The heavy metals are still there, but instead of leaching into the water system and contaminating the water underground, large amounts of these metals may remain bound to the chitin, to the cell walls of filamentous fungi in the soil, and thus remain chemically inactive for as long as 30 years, perhaps longer.

In fact, we can actually use the cell walls of filamentous fungi as a filter, even after the fungi are dead. 

For example, the pharmaceutical Industry grows filamentous fungi in large quantities in the lab, like to produce the antibiotic penicillin, the drug company grows the fungus penicillium, and after the penicillin is extracted, these dead penicillium filaments, we can use the chitin in their cell walls to make industrial filters to adsorb heavy metals. We can put these filters into waste pipes from industrial processes, and use the filters to trap heavy metals, like mercury and zinc. Later, we can chemically extract the heavy metals and reuse the filter over and over.

Now going back to the absorption of toxic metals into the body of the fungus, let's turn our attention to mushrooms.

Like other fungi, mushrooms can absorb large quantities of heavy metals. In fact, they may contain up to two and a half times the concentration of toxic metals found in the soil they grow in. So mushrooms, at least what we see above ground...we can potentially harvest them and then once for all safely *dispose of* the pollutants contained within them.

In fact, to clean up, especially the groundwater system, permanently, harvesting mushrooms is probably the best way to go. For some reason, this hasn't happened yet as far as I know, but I can easily *envision* cultivating mushrooms for the sole purpose of detoxifying a large underground ecosystem.

#### TPO_042_L005_Q001
What is the lecture mainly about?
- Why fungi cannot grow well in polluted ecosystems
- Why fungi pose a danger to the underground water system
- How to prevent heavy metals from getting into the soil
- How fungi can clean up pollution that is in the soil
Right : D	

#### TPO_042_L005_Q002
What does the professor say about the way fungi get their food?
- They use certain metal compounds in the soil as nutrients.
- The enzymes that they produce allow them to absorb organic nutrients from the soil.
- They separate nutrients from heavy metals and then return the metals to the soil.
- Heavy metals interfere with their way of getting nutrients from the soil.
Right : B	

#### TPO_042_L005_Q003
What two points does the professor make about chitin?
- Chitin binds strongly to certain heavy metals.
- Insects need chitin in order to digest the fungi they eat.
- Chitin can be added to soil to create a good habitat for fungi.
- The cell walls of fungi, like the exoskeletons of insects, contain chitin.
Right : AD	

#### TPO_042_L005_Q004
What do adsorption and absorption in fungi have in common?
- They both can help the production of new filaments.
- They both can increase the production of chitin.
- They both can help keep pollutants out of groundwater.
- They both result in the strengthening of cell walls.
Right : C	

#### TPO_042_L005_Q005
Why does the professor mention the antibiotic penicillin?
- To suggest that more fungi should be investigated as potential sources of medications
- To point out that certain heavy metals are needed for the production of penicillin
- To criticize the pharmaceutical industry for contributing to environmental pollution
- To show how a waste product from one process can be useful in another process
Right : D	

#### TPO_042_L005_Q006
Why does the professor say this:
- She does not have time to fully explain the reason.
- She is hopeful that students will be able to figure out the reason.
- She wonders why mushrooms are not already used for cleaning up pollution.
- She realizes that the research she has been discussing is still in its early stages.
