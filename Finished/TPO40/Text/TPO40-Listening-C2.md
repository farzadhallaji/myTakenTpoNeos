Conversation2

Narrator:
Listen to a conversation between a student and a university librarian.

Student:
Mr. Reese. I am Jennifer Lee. I worked on the photography exhibition last year, the one that was commemorating the university's 100th anniversary. I helped select and display photos for the exhibit. I helped set it all up, remember?

Professor:
Oh, sure! You're the photography student that Professor Ryan sent to us. How have you been?

Student:
Good. Thanks. And l...uh...well; I was hoping I could talk to you about a job actually.

Professor:
Oh, the job here in our library archive? Ha, that was fast! We just posted it yesterday.

Student:
Oh,no. Actually, it's for a photography job in the portrait studio at the mall.

Professor:
Taking portrait photos? Sounds like a great job for a photography student. But how can I help?

Student:
Well, I went for an interview, but I still need to give them professional references from people I've worked for. And well, I don't have a lot of work experience. But you know, you've...you've seen how...how I helped plan and carry a project through and showed up on time and everything. So, I was kind of hoping l...you know, I could give them your name as someone they could talk to. 

Professor:
Of course, we all thought you did a great job. I remember saying that to Professor Ryan and he thought so too. I suppose you've already asked him for a recommendation?

Student:
I have. He's actually the one who convinced me to apply for it. I wasn't sure I should. I mean, having real photography experience would be great for my resume, but...well...I am little concerned about the hours. It's ten hours a week, which is fine, but they're all during the daytime. I would have to schedule several classes for the late afternoon and evening. I am not sure I will be able to do that.

Professor:
Yeah, I see how that could be a problem. Well, maybe you should consider the job I mentioned. We just got a grant to hire a part-time library assistant for our photography archives. It doesn't involve taking pictures, but it does involve working with pictures, filling requests for specific photos from students and professors. And it;s in the evenings from 6 to 9, three days a week.

Student:
Hmm, well, the hours are definitely better, but I really do want to find out about that job at the studio first. I am sure you will understand.

Professor
Of course. But if it doesn't work out, keep us in mind.
