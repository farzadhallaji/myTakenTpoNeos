Lecture4

Narrator:
Listen to part of a lecture in a physics class. The professor has been discussing electromagnetic waves.

Professor:
So are there any questions before we continue our discussion of different types of electromagnetic waves? Um, today, we'll focus on radio waves, and specifically, very low frequency radio waves. Yes, Tim.

Student:
Are you going to talk at all about the difference between radio waves and sound waves?

Professor:
Uh, Ok. That might be a good place to start actually. Sound waves are mechanical in nature, right? They can only originate and spread in places where there’s some dense physical medium, like atmosphere or water. They result from changes in pressure in that medium, like changes in air pressure. So they can’t travel through a vacuum, where there is no dense physical medium, which is why they can’t travel through interplanetary space.

Radio waves, on the other hand, are fundamentally different from sound waves. They are electromagnetic. They result from oscillations of the electromagnetic field and don't need a physical medium, so they, like other types of electromagnetic wave, can travel basically anywhere, through a vacuum, or through atmosphere or water.

Now, radio waves can be detected. For example, very low frequency radio waves can be detected with a special type of radio receiver called a very low frequency radio or VLF radio, which can pick up radio waves with very low frequencies, from 3 to 30 kilohertz, which aren't really picked up by a regular *household* or car radio. So VLF radios pick up VLF radio waves and convert them to sounds we can hear.

Um, on Earth, the main source of naturally occurring VLF emissions is lightning, which generates a pulse of radio waves every time it flashes. Yes, Laura.

Student:
Since you almost always get *lightning* with thunderstorms. We can pick up VLF waves pretty often, right? You just have to wait until there is a thunderstorm.

Professor:
Ah, do you? Have to wait? VLF receivers are very sensitive and VLF waves travel very far. So we can pick up emissions from lightning that's far away. So actually, you can pretty much listen to them all the time because lightning strikes Earth constantly, about a hundred times per second. Even if there is no lightning where you are, with a VLF radio, you can hear the *crackling* from storms that are thousands of kilometers away.

However, some times of day are better than others for picking up VLF waves. Daytime isn't as good as night time, for example. And what's more, my colleague Denis Gallagher says, and in my opinion, he's right. He says the best time to listen for them is around sunset or sunrise. That's when there’re natural *waveguides* in the local atmosphere.

Student:
Did you say waveguide?

Professor:
Yes, a waveguide. Usually it refers to a device, like a metal conductor that's used to guide and direct waves. But waveguides also occur naturally. They make a path for radio waves to follow in our atmosphere. These natural waveguides occur when the Sun is rising or setting, which makes sunrise and sunset good times to pick up VLF emissions.

Now, there are a few different sounds that you can hear on a VLF receiver, because when lightning strikes the radio waves travel different distances and in different ways before they reach the receiver.

Some really interesting ones are called *whistlers*. Whistlers come from lightning-generated radio waves that leave earth's atmosphere and travel into earth's magnetosphere before bouncing back down. Not all radio waves do this and the sound they make, well, we call them whistlers because they sound like slowly descending tones. And no two whistlers are alike. To me, they're the most *intriguing*.

Another interesting sound is the *tweek*. Tweeks are the result of VLF waves that have travelled a long distance through the waveguides. They produce a *chirpy* sound because the higher frequency parts of the wave reach the radio receiver before the lower frequency parts.  The entire wave is still considered very low frequency. It's just that some parts of the wave have lower frequencies than others, OK?

Right : D	Chose : B


#### TPO_043_L006_Q002
What is one difference between radio waves and sound waves that the professor emphasizes?
- Radio waves have a lower frequency.
- Water stops radio waves from spreading but does not stop sound waves.
- Unlike sound waves, radio waves can travel outside Earth’s atmosphere.
- Naturally occurring radio waves are difficult to detect on Earth at night.
Right : C	Chose : C


#### TPO_043_L006_Q003
What explanation does the professor give for the constant occurrence of VLF emissions on Earth?
- At any given time, some part of the world is experiencing sunrise or sunset.
- Waveguides constantly form in the atmosphere.
- Earth’s magnetosphere directs interplanetary waves toward Earth’s surface.
- Lightning occurs constantly on the planet.
Right : D	Chose : D


#### TPO_043_L006_Q004
Why are sunrise and sunset the best times to listen to VLF signals?
- Because thunderstorms are most likely to occur then
- Because radio waves travel through natural waveguides then
- Because higher-frequency signals are less active then
- Because temperatures are not extremely high or low then
Right : B	Chose : B


#### TPO_043_L006_Q005
Why does the professor discuss whistlers and tweeks?
- To illustrate that the path a VLF wave travels can affect the sound it makes on a radio
- To point out that VLF waves can affect the sounds heard on a household or car radio
- To describe how a colleague discovered the origin of VLF waves
- To clarify the difference between VLF waves and other kinds of waves
Right : A	Chose : A


#### TPO_043_L006_Q006
What does the professor imply when he says this:
- He needs to think before he can answer the woman’s question.
- The woman has underestimated how often VLF waves can be detected.
- The woman does not realize that waiting for a thunderstorm can take a long time.
- The woman does not understand the relationship between thunderstorms and lightning.
Right : B	Chose : B
