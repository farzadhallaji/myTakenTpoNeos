- Altogether, roughly two tons of meteorite fragments were recovered, all of which bear the name Allende for the location of the first discovery.

  TPO22-R-P3

  ```
  This sentence begins with an adverbial phrase "Altogether," which serves to summarize or indicate a total amount. The main clause "roughly two tons of meteorite fragments were recovered" uses a passive voice construction, where the subject (meteorite fragments) receives the action of being recovered. This emphasizes the fragments rather than who recovered them. The relative clause "all of which bear the name Allende for the location of the first discovery" provides additional information about the fragments. The phrase "all of which" refers back to the meteorite fragments, linking the naming of the fragments to their discovery location.

-  When broken open, Allende stones are revealed to contain an assortment of small, distinctive objects, spherical or irregular in shape and embedded in a dark gray matrix (binding material), which were once constituents of the solar nebula — the interstellar cloud of gas and dust out of which our solar system was formed.

  TPO22-R-P3

  ```
  This sentence is complex with multiple clauses. It begins with a temporal clause "When broken open," setting the condition under which the following information is revealed. The passive voice "are revealed" shifts focus to what is contained within the Allende stones rather than who reveals it. The main clause describes the contents as "an assortment of small, distinctive objects..." The use of adjectives like "small" and "distinctive" adds detail to the objects described. The participle phrase "embedded in a dark gray matrix" further describes how these objects are situated, using a present participle to add continuous or ongoing action. The relative clause "which were once constituents of the solar nebula" expands on the nature of the matrix, linking it to its cosmic origin.

- These seeds are actually chondrules: millimeter-sized melted droplets of silicate material that were cooled into spheres of glass and crystal. A few chondrules contain grains that survived the melting event, so these enigmatic chondrules must have formed when compact masses of nebular dust were fused at high temperatures — approaching 1,700 degrees Celsius — and then cooled before these surviving grains could melt.

  TPO22-R-P3

  ```
  This sentence provides a definition and description. "These seeds are actually chondrules" functions as a defining clause where "chondrules" is defined directly after the colon. The following description uses a relative clause "that were cooled into spheres of glass and crystal" to describe how the chondrules formed. The next sentence includes a causal relationship "so these enigmatic chondrules must have formed when..." explaining the circumstances of their formation using a temporal subordinate clause starting with "when." This clause contains a past perfect passive construction "were fused" emphasizing the action on the nebular dust by the high temperatures.

- They are composed of minerals uncommon on Earth, all rich in calcium, aluminum, and titanium, the most refractory of the major elements in the nebula.

  TPO22-R-P3

  ```
  This simple sentence starts with the subject "They" and the verb "are composed," using a passive form to describe composition. The phrase "of minerals uncommon on Earth" serves as a prepositional phrase giving more information about the minerals' rarity. The appositive phrase "all rich in calcium, aluminum, and titanium" further specifies the types of minerals, and the subsequent phrase "the most refractory of the major elements in the nebula" provides additional detail about their properties, using a superlative form to emphasize their extreme nature in resisting heat.

- However, detailed studies of the chondrite matrix suggest that much of it, too, has been formed by condensation or melting in the nebula, although minute amounts of surviving interstellar dust are mixed with the processed materials.

  TPO22-R-P3

  ```
  This complex sentence starts with the transition word "However," indicating a contrast or complication to previous information. The main clause "detailed studies of the chondrite matrix suggest that much of it, too, has been formed by condensation or melting in the nebula" uses a passive construction "has been formed" to indicate the process affecting the chondrite matrix. The adverb "too" suggests that this information adds to previously known facts. The subordinate clause "although minute amounts of surviving interstellar dust are mixed with the processed materials" introduces an exception or contrasting detail, using "although" to soften the assertion made in the main clause.
