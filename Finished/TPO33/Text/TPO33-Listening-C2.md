Narrator
Listen to a conversation between a student and his biology professor.

Student
Professor Landrea. 

Professor
Hi, Dennis. You are right on time. Come on in and have a seat.

Student
Great! Thanks. 

Professor
So like I told you in class, I just wanted to take a few minutes to meet with everyone to make sure your class presentations for next week are all in order and coming along well. And as you know, you are supposed to report on some area of recent research in genetics, something…you know…original. 

Student
Well, I think I found just the thing! It actually occurred to me a couple nights ago while I was eating dinner in the cafeteria. Tell me professor, do you like broccoli?

Professor
Broccoli? You mean the vegetable broccoli? 

Student
Yeah. 
 
Professor
Well, I guess not really.

Student
Me neither. I have never liked it or most other vegetables for that matter…Brussels sprouts, asparagus, cauliflower…you name it. They just taste *bitter* and…well…*nasty* to me. My mother always called me a picky eater. 

Professor
OK…And?

Student
And so I got to wondering: I mean, I am obviously not the only person like this. So is this just because of some…like trauma from our childhoods? Some bad experience we’ve had with some vegetables? Or could there be some genetic explanation for why some people are picky eaters and others aren’t?

Professor
OK. I see. Well, I suppose it’s a possibility. 

Student
Actually, it turns out it’s more than a possibility. I started doing some research in the library that night and I found out that a biologist at the National Institutes of Health has been looking at that very question recently. 

Professor
Well, I guess that’s not too surprising. And this is great stuff actually. So what’s the *verdict*?

Student
Well, this guy seems to have discovered a particular gene that actually makes it possible for people to taste the bitterness in certain green vegetables. But people who have a mutation in that gene cannot taste the bitterness. 

Professor
Well…that’s certainly fascinating! But…so this biologist is basically claiming that people who like to eat these vegetables actually have some sort of sensory *deficit*? Sort of makes us picky eaters than normal ones, doesn’t it? I mean, *that’s kind of turning things on their head*, isn’t it?

Student
Well…then again, *it wouldn’t be the first time*, would it? Think of it this way: humans originally needed to have a stronger sensitivity to bitter-tasting foods so they could learn what plants were good for them and which ones might be poisonous. But at some point, as people figured out what they could safely eat, this need became less crucial and a segment of the population lost that ability. 

Professor
OK. Well, you make a *compelling case*. I can’t wait to hear more about this when you deliver your report.

Why does the professor meet with the student?
- To determine if the student has selected an appropriate topic for his class project
- To find out if the student is interested in taking part in a genetics project
- To discuss the student’s experiment on taste perception
- To explain what the student should focus on for his class presentation
Right : A	Chose : A


#### TPO_033_L004_Q002
Why does the student ask the professor about broccoli?
- To get her to describe some of its genetic features
- To find out if she is familiar with recent research on vegetable DNA
- To introduce an idea that he has had for a research topic
- To help explain why he needs extra time to prepare his presentation
Right : C	Chose : C


#### TPO_033_L004_Q003
What possible causes does the student consider for not liking the taste of vegetables?
- A genetic predisposition
- Cooking methods that fail to remove the vegetables’ bitter taste
- A bad childhood experience associated with eating vegetables
- Not being served enough vegetables during childhood
Right : AC	Chose :  AC


#### TPO_033_L004_Q004
According to the student, why was it advantageous for early humans to be sensitive to bitter tastes?
- It helped them to identify vegetables as sources of vitamins.
- It helped them to avoid eating foods that were not healthy for them.
- It made them less likely to limit their diet to sweet and salty foods.
- It allowed them to distinguish between ripe and unripe vegetables.
Right : B	Chose : B


#### TPO_033_L004_Q005
What does the student imply when he says this:
- He has often disagreed with the professor in the past.
- The biologist in question has a history of *advocating* nontraditional ideas.
- Biologists’ research methods are sometimes regarded as unusual by other scientists.
- Scientific explanations are sometimes contrary to what people might expect.
Right : D	Chose : C
