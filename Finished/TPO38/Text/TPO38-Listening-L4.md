Narrator:
Listen to part of a lecture in an astronomy class.

Professor：
Last week we discussed the formation of Earth and the other rocky planets, of planets in the inner solar system. Uh, so, what about the gas giants? Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.

Well, there’s two theories. But first, let's recap. We believe our solar system began as a huge spinning cloud of dust and gas, which flattened and eventually collapsed in on itself. The matter it's centered condensed into a ball of hot gas and dust, eventually becoming our sun. And what happened to the remaining cloud?

To the disk encircling the sun when it was a young star?

Student：
The rocky planets were born. Um, dust, little grains of rock and metal within the disk collided with each other and stuck together, and this process sort of *snowballed* over millions of years until the *chunks* grew into mini-planets, proto-planets.

Professor：
Yeah. This process is called *accretion*. And we call the disk an accretion disk.

Now, think of it as two parts: an inner accretion disk, and an outer accretion disk. In the inner part, once an object gets large enough, that object's gravitational field gets stronger, which speeds up the accretion process. You know, larger objects attract smaller ones and sort of *gobble* them up. And eventually, you get a full-sized planet in its own orbit.

Okay. That's how the inner rocky planets probably formed by accretion.

But what about those gas planets in the outer solar system, in the outer accretion disk?
Well, the first theory says the accretion process was similar to the one that formed the rocky planets, with some key differences.

Remember, the gas giants are farther from the sun, where temperatures are much colder. So, in the outer accretion disk, compounds like water and ammonia exist in frozen form. Closer to the sun, they're more likely to be vaporized by solar radiation. What this means is that in addition to rocky and metallic particles there would be other solids like frozen water and frozen ammonia.

Student：
So more solid substances are available to *clump into* *protoplanets*, right?

Professor：
Precisely! So the solid cores of the gas giants could *conceivably* have formed by accretion. And once their mass reaches a certain point, around about 5 to 10 Earths, what would happen?

Student：
5 to 10 Earths...uh, with a mass that big, I guess gravity would start to pull in more and more material faster, right?

Professor：
Material, meaning gas. It would rapidly pull in more and more gas from the accretion disk, so you end up with a solid core of rock, metal and ice surrounded by massive amounts of gas. That's the core accretion theory.

Now, the other theory is called the disk *instability* theory.

The disk instability theory holds that gas begins the planet-making process, without a solid core. You see, most of the outer accretion disk would have been gas. We believe solid particles probably made up just one percent of the outer accretion disk.

So this theory suggests that large planets, the gas giants, uh, they develop from large clumps of mostly gas and some dust in an accretion disk. Outer regions of an accretion disk can be unstable, gravitationally unstable, which is what causes these clumps to form, and in some cases, grow in to proto-planets.

Over time, dust particles within a gas *clump* *coalesce*, bond together, and eventually fall toward the center, creating a core. Once this happens, the gas clump grows relatively quickly as its gravity pulls in more and more gas and dust particles. And this whole process can theoretically happen within one hundred thousand years.

- To compare the composition of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune
- To explain why young stars are often surrounded by disks of gas and dust
Right : B	Chose : B


#### TPO_038_L006_Q002
Why does the professor review the formation of rocky planets?
- To contrast it with the formation of the Sun
- To correct a common misunderstanding about accretion
- To use the information as the basis for another topic of discussion
- To introduce recent discoveries about rocky planets in other solar systems
Right : C	Chose : C


#### TPO_038_L006_Q003
What point does the professor emphasize when he mentions water and ammonia?
- Solid forms of water and ammonia may have contributed to the formation of the gas giants.
- Water and ammonia were not common substances in the outer accretion disk.
- Water and ammonia are pulled in by the gravity of protoplanets more readily than other substances are.
- Most substances found in the core of rocky planets are also found in the core of gas planets.
Right : A	Chose : A


#### TPO_038_L006_Q004
According to the professor, what could have occurred when a protoplanet in the outer accretion disk reached a mass of five to ten Earths?
- It started to shed grains of rock and metal into the solar system.
- Its gravity began to pull in huge amounts of the surrounding gas.
- Its gravity caused clumps to form in the surrounding gas.
- It collided with smaller protoplanets.
Right : B	Chose : B


#### TPO_038_L006_Q005
According to the professor, what are two claims of the disk-instability theory?
- Gas planet formation did not begin with a solid core.
- Gas planets cannot form in extremely cold temperatures.
- Gas planet formation can occur anywhere in the accretion disk.
- Gas planets form over a relatively short time.
Right : AD	Chose :  AD


#### TPO_038_L006_Q006
What is the professor’s opinion about the disk-instability theory?
- It differs from the core-accretion theory in relatively insignificant ways.
- It does not take into account the amount of time needed for gas planets to form.
- It is more applicable to star formation than the core-accretion theory is.
- It is more plausible than the core-accretion theory for the formation of gas planets.
Right : D	Chose : B
