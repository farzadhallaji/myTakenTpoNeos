TPO27-R-P1

- "A variety of documentation indicates that certain goods, once made by a family member as one of many duties, were later made by skilled artisans."
  1. **Passive Voice**: The sentence employs the passive voice ("were made"), which is common in formal or academic English to focus on the action or condition rather than the subject doing the action.
  2. **Relative Clauses**: The use of the relative clause ("once made by a family member as one of many duties") provides additional information about the goods without starting a new sentence.
  3. **Past Simple vs. Past Perfect**: The past perfect tense ("once made") is used to indicate that one past action was completed before another took place.
