 

- It grows in the intertidal zone (the area covered by water some parts of the day and exposed others).

  TPO22-R-P1

    ```
    The phrase "and exposed others" refers to the fact that the intertidal zone is an area that is sometimes covered by water and sometimes not.

    In other words, "exposed others" means that during certain parts of the day (e.g. at low tide), the area is not covered by water and is instead exposed to the air. This is in contrast to other parts of the day (e.g. at high tide), when the area is covered by water.

    So, the phrase "and exposed others" is describing the alternating pattern of water coverage and exposure to air that occurs in the intertidal zone.

- Unlike most major inventions, photography had been long and impatiently awaited. 

  TPO22-R-P2

    ```
    This sentence uses a past perfect continuous tense ("had been awaited") to indicate that photography was expected for a long time before it was invented. The phrase "Unlike most major inventions" at the beginning sets up a comparison, suggesting that photography was more eagerly anticipated than other inventions. "Long and impatiently" are adverbs that describe how the waiting was done.
    ```

- Photography did indeed make certain kinds of painting obsolete.

  TPO22-R-P2

  ```
  This sentence uses the simple past tense ("did make") emphasized by "did indeed" for a stronger assertion. It states that photography caused some types of painting to become outdated or no longer used. "Certain kinds" refers to specific types of painting without specifying which ones.
  ```

  

- The daguerreotype virtually did away with the portrait miniature.

  TPO22-R-P2

  ```
  This sentence also uses the simple past tense, emphasized with "did" (in "did away with"), indicating that the daguerreotype effectively ended the popularity or common use of portrait miniatures. "Virtually" is an adverb that softens the statement slightly, implying it was not complete but was almost the case.

- Portraiture, once a luxury for the privileged few, was suddenly well within the reach of many more people.

  TPO22-R-P2

  ```
  This sentence uses the simple past tense ("was") to describe a change in accessibility. "Once" refers to the past when portraiture was only available to the wealthy ("the privileged few"), but it "was suddenly well within the reach of many more people," meaning it became affordable and accessible to a broader audience quickly.

- The new candid photography — unposed pictures that were made when the subjects were unaware that their pictures were being taken — confirmed these scientific results, and at the same time, thanks to the radical cropping (trimming) of images that the camera often imposed, suggested new compositional formats.

  TPO22-R-P2

  ```
  This is a complex sentence with multiple parts:
  1. "The new candid photography" is the subject, described further by a relative clause "unposed pictures that were made when the subjects were unaware that their pictures were being taken." This clause explains what candid photography is.
  2. The verb phrases "confirmed these scientific results" and "suggested new compositional formats" both use the simple past tense.
  3. "At the same time" is a phrase that connects these two ideas, indicating that these events happened simultaneously.
  4. "Thanks to the radical cropping (trimming) of images that the camera often imposed" is another relative clause that explains why new compositional formats were suggested.

- The frequency with which certain simple motifs appear in these oldest sites has led rock-art researchers to adopt a descriptive term — the Panaramitee style — a label which takes its name from the extensive rock pavements at Panaramitee North in desert South Australia, which are covered with motifs pecked into the surface.

  TPO22-R-P3

  ```
  Sentence structure: Complex sentence.
  Main clause: has led rock-art researchers to adopt a descriptive term
  Dependent clauses: The frequency with which certain simple motifs appear in these oldest sites, [which are covered with motifs pecked into the surface]

- In the 1970s, when the study of Australian archaeology was in an exciting phase of development, with the great antiquity of rock art becoming clear, Lesley Maynard, the archaeologist who coined the phrase “Panaramitee style”, suggested that a sequence could be determined for Australian rock art, in which a geometric style gave way to a simple figurative style (outlines of figures and animals), followed by a range of complex figurative styles that, unlike the pan-Australian geometric tradition, tended to much greater regional diversity. 

  TPO22-R-P3

  ```
  Sentence structure: Complex sentence with multiple clauses.
  Main clause: Lesley Maynard suggested that a sequence could be determined for Australian rock art
  Dependent clauses: In the 1970s, [when the study of Australian archaeology was in an exciting phase of development], [with the great antiquity of rock art becoming clear], [in which a geometric style gave way to a simple figurative style], [followed by a range of complex figurative styles that tended to much greater regional diversity]
  Key grammatical features: Multiple temporal clauses introduced by "when" and "in which" show the timing and development process. "Followed by" indicates a sequence of styles.
  
  Persian translation: در دهه 1970، زمانی که مطالعه باستان‌شناسی استرالیا در مرحله هیجان‌انگیزی از توسعه قرار داشت و قدمت بزرگ هنر صخره‌ای روشن شد، لسلی مینارد، باستان‌شناسی که اصطلاح «سبک پانارامیتی» را ابداع کرد، پیشنهاد داد که یک توالی برای هنر صخره‌ای استرالیا مشخص شود، که در آن یک سبک هندسی جای خود را به سبک تصویری ساده (خطوط اشکال و حیوانات) داد، که به دنبال آن محدوده‌ای از سبک‌های تصویری پیچیده آمد که، برخلاف سنت هندسی پان‌استرالیایی، به تنوع منطقه‌ای بسیار بیشتری می‌انجامید.
