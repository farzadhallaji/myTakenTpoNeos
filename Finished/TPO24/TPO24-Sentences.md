- Not only are there differences in the level of the functioning of respiratory systems, there are even changes in how they function.

- Without this muscular action, inhaling is like sucking air out of a balloon—the narrow passages tend to collapse.

- Coupled with these factors is the loss of the complex interactions among the muscles that can change the route of airflow from nose to mouth.

###  "not only... but also" structure

In the "not only... but also" structure, inversion is often used for emphasis, especially in more formal or written English. However, inversion is not always necessary, and in everyday spoken English, the structure can be used without inversion. Here are both forms:

### With Inversion (Formal/Emphatic)
- **Example**: "Not only did he win the race, but he also broke the record."
  - **Inversion**: "Not only did he" (instead of "he did not only").

### Without Inversion (Common in Spoken English)
- **Example**: "He not only won the race, but he also broke the record."
  - **No Inversion**: "He not only" (usual subject-verb order).

### More Examples:

#### With Inversion
- **Formal**: "Not only is she a talented singer, but she is also a skilled dancer."
- **Formal**: "Not only has he finished his homework, but he has also cleaned his room."

#### Without Inversion
- **Common**: "She not only sings beautifully, but she also dances gracefully."
- **Common**: "He not only finished his homework, but he also cleaned his room."
