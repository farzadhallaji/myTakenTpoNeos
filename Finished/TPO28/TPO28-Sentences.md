**"The water table is not flat but usually follows the contours of the topography, the shape of a surface such as Earth’s, including the rise and fall of such features as mountains and valleys."**

- **Structure**: This sentence is structured to contrast two ideas about the water table.
- Key Points:
  - **Contrastive structure**: "not... but..." is used to show contrast between the flatness of the water table and its actual undulating nature.
  - **Present simple tense**: "is" and "follows" indicate general truths or habitual actions, typical in descriptions of natural phenomena.
  - **Comma after 'topography'**: This comma is used to add a clarifying element about what topography involves, introducing an appositive that explains what topography means in this context.
- Vocabulary:
  - **"Contours"**: This noun is important as it refers to the outline that represents the shape of the land, crucial in understanding geographical and geological descriptions.

**"In particularly wet years, short stretches of an otherwise dry stream-bed may have flowing water because the water table rises to intersect the land surface."**

- **Structure**: This is a complex sentence that describes a conditional situation leading to a specific result.
- Key Points:
  - **Conditional introductory clause**: "In particularly wet years," sets the scene for occasional or rare circumstances.
  - **Modal verb "may"**: Indicates possibility, suggesting that the event described is not certain but likely under specific conditions.
  - **Causation with "because"**: Explains the reason behind the water's presence, linking it to the behavior of the water table.
  - **Phrase Components**: "short stretches of an otherwise dry stream-bed"
    - **Short stretches**: This refers to specific, limited sections or parts of something longer. In this context, it refers to parts of the stream-bed.
    - **Of an otherwise dry stream-bed**: This part of the phrase provides context and contrast. "Otherwise" indicates that the general condition or usual state of the stream-bed is dry. The phrase suggests that while most of the stream-bed is typically dry, there are exceptions.
      - **Adjective "short"**: Specifies the length of the parts being described, indicating they are not extensive.
      - **Noun "stretches"**: Used here to mean lengths or sections.
      - **Conjunction "of"**: Connects "short stretches" to what they are part of — the stream-bed.
      - **Adjective "dry"**: Describes the usual state of the stream-bed, indicating lack of water.
      - **Adverb "otherwise"**: A key term that introduces the general state of being dry, implying a deviation in the parts mentioned (short stretches).
- Vocabulary:
  - **"Intersects"**: A verb that means to cross or meet, critical in understanding how geological features interact with each other.

1. By this time, the Saharan people were probably using domestic crops, experimenting with such summer rainfall crops as sorghum and millet as they moved out of areas where they could grow wheat, barley, and other Mediterranean crops.

   **By this time** - Temporal Prepositional Phrase

   - **Role**: Sets the time frame for the action in the sentence, indicating that the actions described were happening at a specific period in the past relative to the events being discussed.

   **the Saharan people** - Noun Phrase (Subject)

   - **Role**: Acts as the subject of the sentence, identifying who is performing the actions described.

   **were probably using** - Verb Phrase (Past Continuous Tense with Modal Adverb)

   - **Role**: Describes the ongoing action of the subject during the past time frame set by the prepositional phrase. The word "probably" modifies the verb phrase, suggesting that the action is likely but not certain.

   **domestic crops** - Noun Phrase (Direct Object)

   - **Role**: Serves as the direct object of the verb "using," specifying what the Saharan people were using.

   **experimenting with** - Participial Phrase (Present Participle)

   - **Role**: Functions as a modifier to the main verb phrase "were probably using," adding additional information about the nature of how the Saharan people were using the crops.

   **such summer rainfall crops as sorghum and millet** - Noun Phrase (Object of the Preposition "with")

   - **Role**: Provides specific examples of the crops being experimented with. The structure "such... as" is used to introduce examples or types of the main category mentioned, in this case, "summer rainfall crops."

   **as they moved out of areas** - Adverbial Clause of Time

   - **Role**: Describes the circumstances under which the experimenting was taking place, linking it to their movement from certain areas.

   **where they could grow wheat, barley, and other Mediterranean crops** - Relative Clause

   - **Role**: Modifies the noun "areas" from the adverbial clause, specifying the characteristics of these areas. The clause explains that these were areas suitable for growing Mediterranean crops like wheat and barley.

     

2. The areas that are now desert were, like all arid regions, very susceptible to cycles of higher and lower levels of rainfall, resulting in major, sudden changes in distributions of plants and animals.

   **"The areas that are now desert were, like all arid regions, very susceptible to cycles of higher and lower levels of rainfall"** - This part of the sentence indicates that the areas, which have since become desert, were extremely vulnerable to fluctuations in rainfall. "Susceptible" here means likely to be affected by; thus, these regions were highly responsive to changes in how much rain they received. The use of "like all arid regions" serves as a comparison, suggesting that this susceptibility is a common characteristic among all dry areas. Arid regions typically have fragile ecosystems that can be greatly impacted by even small changes in moisture levels. A higher-than-usual rainfall can lead to temporary boosts in plant life and available water, while a drop can intensify dry conditions, potentially leading to desertification.

   **"resulting in major, sudden changes in distributions of plants and animals"** - This part explains the consequences or effects of the fluctuating rainfall levels. The word "resulting" introduces a result clause that specifies what happens because of the susceptibility to rainfall changes. Major and sudden shifts in the distribution of plants and animals occur as a result of these rainfall cycles. When there's more rain, plant growth can explode and attract a diverse array of wildlife, benefiting from the abundance. Conversely, a decrease in rainfall can rapidly diminish water and food sources, forcing animals to migrate or causing plant populations to decline, which affects the whole ecosystem's stability.
