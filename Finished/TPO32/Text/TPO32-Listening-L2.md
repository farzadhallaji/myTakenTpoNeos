Lecture2-Biology (Populations in an Ecosystem)

Listen to part of a lecture in a biology class.
 
Student
Professor, since we are going to talk about changes in animal populations in the wild, I’d like to ask about somethingI read in an article online, about how the population size of some animal species can affect other animal species, and how other environmental factors come into play too. 

Professor
Right. Relationships between animal species in a given ecosystem can get pretty complex. Because in addition to predator-prey relationships, there are other variables that affect population size.

Student
The article mentioned that populations of predators and their prey might go up rapidly and then decline all of a sudden. 

Student
Oh. Yeah! I read about that in my ecology class. It happens in cycles. I think that’s called a *boom-and-bust* cycle. Right?

Professor
OK. Well, hold on a second. First I want to go over some key concepts. Let’s say there was a species that had access to plenty of food and ideal conditions. Under those circumstances, its population would increase exponentially, meaning it would increase at an ever-accelerating pace. 

Student
Wow! That sounds a little scary. 

Professor
Well, it doesn’t usually happen. Like you said, a rapid population growth is often followed by a sudden decline. But we do occasionally see exponential growth in nonnative species when they are transplanted into a new environment. Um…because they face little competition and have favorable growing conditions. 

But for most species, most of the time, resources are finite. There’s only so much available … *which leads me to my point*. Every ecosystem has what we call a carrying capacity. The carrying capacity is the maximum population size of a species that can be sustained by the resources of a particular ecosystem. Resources are, of course, food, water, and just as important, space.

Although every species has a maximum rate at which the population of that species could increase, assuming ideal conditions for the species in its environment. There are always going to be environmental factors that limit population growth. This is called environmental resistance. Environmental resistance is important becauseit stops populations from growing out of control. Factors such food supply, predation and disease affect population size, and can change from year to year or season to season. 

Student
OK. I think I get it. 

Professor
Well, let’s look at a case study. That should make things clear. Some years ago, some of my colleagues conducted an experiment in an *oak* forest involving three different species: white-footed *mice*, gypsy *moths* and oak trees.
OK. Now let me explain what the situation is in this forest. Oak trees produce *acorns*, and acorns are a primary food source for white-footed mice. Another food source for the white-footed mice is the gypsy moth. So the size of the gypsy moth population is controlled by the white-footed mice, which is a good thing because gypsy moth caterpillars are considered pests. They *strip away* the leaves from the oak trees every ten years or so. 

Student
So the mice eat both acorns from the oak trees and gypsy moths. And the gypsy moth caterpillars eat oak tree leaves. 

Professor
Right. Now, what makes this set of relationships particularly interesting is that oak trees only produce a large number of acorns every few years. 

Student
So during the years with fewer acorns, the white-footed mice have to deal with a smaller food supply. 

Professor
Yes. But in the years with large amounts of acorns, the mice have more food, which leads to…?

Student
The white-footed mice population growing.

Professor
And the gypsy moth population decreasing.

Student
How can we know that for sure? It seems like a big jump from more acorns to fewer gypsy moths. 

Professor
Well, we can know for sure because in this oak forest, the researchers decided to test the links between acorns and the two animal species. In some parts of the forest, they had volunteers drop a large number of extra acorns on the forest floor. And in another section of the forest, they removed a number of white-footed mice. In the forest areas where extra acorns had been dropped, the gypsy moth population soon went into a significant decline. But in the section of the forest where the white-footed mice had been removed, the gypsy moth population exploded.

Right : A	Chose : A


#### TPO_032_L003_Q002
Why does the professor mention nonnative species?
- To show that some species cannot be transplanted easily to new environments
- To give an example of rapid population growth that is not followed by decline
- To emphasize that species with rapidly growing populations harm ecosystems
- To introduce a study on the changing population size of certain species
Right : B	Chose : B


#### TPO_032_L003_Q003
What point does the professor make when she discusses the carrying capacity of an ecosystem?
- The availability of food is more important for species than the availability of space.
- The amount of environmental resistance in an ecosystem does not change over time.
- Environmental resistance controls the population size of species in an ecosystem.
- The population size of most species increases at a constant rate.
Right : C	Chose : C


#### TPO_032_L003_Q004
How did the researchers test the links between acorns, white-footed mice, and gypsy moths in a forest?
- They supplied an additional food source for gypsy moths.
- They introduced gypsy moths to areas where there had been none.
- They cleared oak trees from some areas where both animal species lived.
- They manipulated the numbers of mice and acorns in some areas.
Right : D	Chose : C


#### TPO_032_L003_Q005
What does the professor say can lead to a change in the gypsy moth population in a forest?
- An increase in the number of tree species in a forest
- An increase in the number of acorns produced by oak trees
- A decrease in the population of white-footed mice
- A decrease in oak tree leaves caused by gypsy moth caterpillars
Right : BC	Chose :  BC


#### TPO_032_L003_Q006
What can be inferred about the professor when she says this:
