#### A fertile, plowed field is rapidly invaded by a large variety of weeds, whereas a neighboring construction site from which the soil has been compacted or removed to expose a coarse, infertile parent material may remain virtually free of vegetation for many months or even years despite receiving the same input of seeds as the plowed field.

1. **whereas**: A conjunction used to contrast two different situations. It introduces a clause that contrasts with the previous one about the fertile, plowed field.

2. **a neighboring construction site**: 
   - **a** (determiner): Indicates a singular, unspecified construction site.
   - **neighboring** (adjective): Describes the construction site as being near or adjacent to something else, in this case, the plowed field.
   - **construction site** (noun): A place where construction work is happening.

3. **from which the soil has been compacted or removed**:
   - **from** (preposition): Indicates the origin or starting point of the action.
   - **which** (relative pronoun): Refers back to the construction site.
   - **the soil has been compacted or removed**: A relative clause modifying "construction site."
     - **the soil** (noun phrase): The earth or dirt at the construction site.
     - **has been compacted** (verb phrase): Indicates that the soil has been pressed down tightly.
     - **or removed** (conjunction + verb phrase): Indicates that the soil might have been taken away instead of compacted.

4. **to expose a coarse, infertile parent material**:
   - **to expose** (infinitive verb): Indicates the purpose of compacting or removing the soil, which is to reveal something underneath.
   - **a coarse, infertile parent material** (noun phrase):
     - **a** (determiner): Indicates a singular, unspecified type of material.
     - **coarse** (adjective): Describes the material as rough in texture.
     - **infertile** (adjective): Describes the material as not suitable for growing plants.
     - **parent material** (noun): The underlying geological material (rock or sediment) in which soil horizons form.

##### Explanation:
- The phrase **"whereas a neighboring construction site from which the soil has been compacted or removed to expose a coarse, infertile parent material"** contrasts the construction site with the fertile, plowed field.
- At this construction site, the soil has either been tightly pressed down (compacted) or taken away (removed), which has revealed (exposed) an underlying layer of rough, unproductive soil (parent material).

___

- "If colonizers produce short-lived reproductive propagules, then they must produce very large numbers unless they have an efficient means of dispersal to suitable new habitats. Many plants depend on wind for dispersal and produce abundant quantities of small, relatively short-lived seeds to compensate for the fact that wind is not always a reliable means of reaching the appropriate type of habitat. Alternative strategies have evolved in some plants, such as those that produce fewer but larger seeds that are dispersed to suitable sites by birds or small mammals or those that produce long-lived seeds. Many forest plants seem to exhibit the *latter* adaptation, and *viable* seeds of pioneer species can be found in large numbers on some forest floors."

The word **"latter"** refers to the second of two alternative strategies mentioned in the previous sentence. The two strategies are:

1. Producing fewer but larger seeds that are dispersed to suitable sites by birds or small mammals.
2. Producing long-lived seeds.

Therefore, **"latter"** refers to the strategy of producing long-lived seeds. The sentence is stating that many forest plants seem to exhibit the adaptation of producing long-lived seeds.

### What is a Pro-form?

A pro-form is a type of word or phrase that stands in for (or substitutes) another word, phrase, clause, or sentence whose meaning is recoverable from the context. Pro-forms are used to avoid repetition and make sentences less cumbersome. They can refer to nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, or entire sentences.

### Types of Pro-forms:

1. **Pronouns**: Substitute for nouns or noun phrases.
   - Example: "John is a student. **He** studies hard." (Here, "he" is a pronoun substituting for "John.")
   
2. **Pro-verbs**: Substitute for verb phrases.
   - Example: "She can dance, and she will **do** so at the party." (Here, "do so" is a pro-verb substituting for "dance.")

3. **Pro-adjectives**: Substitute for adjectives.
   - Example: "I want the blue shirt, not the red **one**." (Here, "one" is a pro-adjective substituting for "shirt.")

4. **Pro-adverbs**: Substitute for adverbs.
   - Example: "He ran quickly, and she did **too**." (Here, "too" is a pro-adverb substituting for "ran quickly.")

5. **Pro-sentences**: Substitute for whole sentences or clauses.
   - Example: "Will you be attending the meeting? **Yes**, I will." (Here, "yes" is a pro-sentence substituting for "I will be attending the meeting.")

### Examples of Pro-forms in Sentences:

1. **Pronouns**:
   - "The children played in the park. **They** had a great time."
   - "Sarah bought a new car. **It** is very fast."

2. **Pro-verbs**:
   - "I didn’t finish my homework, but I will **do** so tonight."
   - "He could jump high, but now he can’t **do** it anymore."

3. **Pro-adjectives**:
   - "I need a bigger bag. This one isn’t big enough."
   - "Do you have a blue pen? I only have a black **one**."

4. **Pro-adverbs**:
   - "She sings beautifully, and her sister does **too**."
   - "I can come early, and you should arrive early **as well**."

5. **Pro-sentences**:
   - "Are you going to the party? **Yes**, I am."
   - "Will it rain tomorrow? **I hope not**."

### Explanation of Usage:

- **Pronouns** are perhaps the most commonly used pro-forms and can refer to previously mentioned people or things.
- **Pro-verbs** like "do so" or "do it" help in avoiding the repetition of verb phrases.
- **Pro-adjectives** such as "one" can replace noun phrases, often accompanied by adjectives.
- **Pro-adverbs** like "too" and "as well" substitute for previously mentioned actions or states in an adverbial form.
- **Pro-sentences** like "yes" and "no" encapsulate entire ideas or responses in a concise form.

Using pro-forms makes language more efficient and helps to avoid redundancy. They ensure that sentences are clear and less repetitive, contributing to the flow of conversation or written text.
