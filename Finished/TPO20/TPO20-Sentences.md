  The dash (—) is used here to introduce additional information that elaborates on the main clause. This is a non-restrictive clause, providing supplementary details without limiting or specifically defining the subject. This structure is common in academic writing to add depth or explanation without altering the main statement's integrity.

  TPO20-R-P1

  ```

The form "improve" here suggests a necessity or obligation, fitting the formal tone of expressing duties or responsibilities. The subjunctive is particularly useful in academic and formal texts to articulate conditions or hypotheses.

- Although flatboats and keelboats continued to be important until the 1850's, steamboats eventually superseded all other craft.

  TPO20-R-P1

  ```
  Subordinate clauses like this one provide additional context or conditions. In this case, it contrasts the continued importance of older rivercraft with the eventual dominance of steamboats, adding depth to the narrative about transportation evolution.
  ```

- Steamboats were not only faster but also transported upriver freight for about one tenth of what it had previously cost on hand-propelled keelboats.

  TPO20-R-P1

  ```
  Comparative forms are used here to highlight the superiority of steamboats over other types of boats in terms of speed and cost-efficiency. This comparative structure is crucial for emphasizing differences or enhancements, which is particularly effective in historical or analytical discussions.

- When one considers the many ways by which organisms are completely destroyed after death, it is remarkable that fossils are as common as they are. 

  TPO20-R-P3

  ```
  This sentence is a complex sentence made up of a main clause and a dependent adverbial clause. The dependent clause "When one considers the many ways by which organisms are completely destroyed after death" introduces the sentence, setting the context for the surprising fact stated in the main clause, "it is remarkable that fossils are as common as they are." The dependent clause uses "when" to indicate a condition or a time, and "one" is used as a general pronoun referring to people in general. The main clause includes a subject "it," a linking verb "is," and a subject complement "remarkable" that describes the subject. The clause "that fossils are as common as they are" acts as a noun clause explaining why it is remarkable.

- Water containing dissolved silica, calcium carbonate, or iron may circulate through the enclosing sediment and be deposited in cavities such as marrow cavities and canals in the bone once occupied by blood vessels and nerves.

  TPO20-R-P3

  ```
  This sentence is a complex sentence with a main clause and a relative clause modifying "water." The main clause "Water...may circulate through the enclosing sediment and be deposited in cavities" uses a modal verb "may" to express possibility. "Water" is the subject, and "circulate" and "be deposited" are verbs connected by "and," showing two actions that may occur. The relative clause "containing dissolved silica, calcium carbonate, or iron" provides additional information about the water, specifying what is dissolved in it. The phrase "such as marrow cavities and canals in the bone once occupied by blood vessels and nerves" further describes the type of cavities, adding detail about their previous contents and location.

- Now, the typical pattern for an interglacial period, and we have studied several, is that the concentration of carbon dioxide and methane gas actually reaches its peak, that is, there is the most carbon dioxide and methane gas, uh, greenhouse gases in the atmosphere just after the beginning of the interglacial period. 

  TPO20-L-L2

  ```
  This complex sentence has several clauses. The main clause is "the typical pattern for an interglacial period [...] is that the concentration of carbon dioxide and methane gas actually reaches its peak." It uses a subject-verb-object structure, where the subject is "the typical pattern for an interglacial period," and the verb is "is." The object is the clause "that the concentration of carbon dioxide and methane gas actually reaches its peak." 
  
  The phrase "and we have studied several" is a parenthetical clause, adding extra information about the patterns studied. It's set off by commas, indicating it can be removed without changing the main sentence's meaning. 
  
  The explanatory phrase "that is, there is the most carbon dioxide and methane gas, uh, greenhouse gases in the atmosphere" further elaborates on what "reaches its peak" means. The interjection "uh" indicates a pause or moment of hesitation in speech. The entire sentence is structured to provide a clear statement followed by a detailed explanation, typical in scientific discourse.

- It’s kind of ironic to think that absent that effect, it maybe that we would be heading into an Ice Age again. 

  TPO20-L-L2

  ```
  This sentence is a complex sentence expressing irony. The main clause is "It’s kind of ironic to think that," which sets up the sentence as a statement about irony. The subordinate clause "absent that effect, it maybe that we would be heading into an Ice Age again" specifies the ironic situation. 
  
  The phrase "absent that effect" functions as a conditional modifier, implying "if that effect were not present." The word "maybe" should be written as "may be" to correctly form the verb phrase meaning "it is possible." The conditional mood is used in "we would be heading into an Ice Age again," expressing a hypothetical situation dependent on the absence of the effect mentioned.
