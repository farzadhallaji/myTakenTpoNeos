Narrator:
Listen to part of a lecture in an archaeology class.

Professor:
In our last class we began talking about animal domestication. And we said it’s the process *whereby* a population of animals is *bred in captivity* and becomes accustomed to being provided for and controlled by humans. Question, Jim?

Student:
Yeah. I was thinking...you said domesticated animals usually served some kind of purpose for humans, like horses could...uh...pull heavy loads, and dogs could hunt or *herd sheep*, but cats, why were they ever domesticated? I mean, mine can't do much of anything.

Professor:
Interesting question. Cats don't seem likely candidates for domestication, do they? They actually lack an important characteristic that most animals that can be domesticated have.
Domesticable animals tend to live in *herds* or packs, with clear dominance hierarchies. Humans could easily take advantage of this hierarchical structure. By *supplanting* the alpha individual, they could gain control of the whole group or of individuals as in the case of dogs. Cats in the wild, though, rarely have this structure. For the most part, they are solitary hunters. But as for their utility to humans, well, it's helpful to think about when and where cat domestication might have begun.
Any ideas, Jim?

Student:
Well, I guess ancient Egypt. Tm thinking of all those ancient Egyptian paintings of cats.

Professor:
Good guess. Those paintings you mentioned do provide the oldest known *depictions* of full cat domestication, where cats are, without question, household companions. The paintings from about 3,600 years ago typically show cats in Egyptian homes *poised* under chairs, sometimes *wearing collars*, eating scraps of food out of bowls.
But the Egyptians don't get credited for the early stages of cat domestication where cats are just beginning to interact with humans. There are signs of early domestication as far back as 9,500 years ago!
Recently, two *grave*s were discovered on the Island of Cyprus.

One was the grave of a human, buried with some tools, sea shells and other items, and nearby, a cat was buried in its own grave. Interestingly, the cat's body was oriented in the same westward direction as the human's body.

Another notable thing about the two bodies was that they were in an identical state of preservation, suggesting they had been buried at the same time. So we can assume that humans had at least some kind of relationship with cats as early as 9,500 years ago!

Student:
So cat domestication began in *Cyprus*?

Professor:
Well, except cats weren't native to Cyprus. They were undoubtedly brought over to the island by boat probably from the nearby coast of the Fertile Crescent in the Middle East. In fact, extensive DNA analysis has now confirmed what archaeologists have believed *for quite some time*. All modern domesticate cats arose from just one subspecies of wild cat from that single location: the Fertile Crescent, and not from any of the other four subspecies of wild cats located in other areas throughout the world. Pretty amazing, isn’t it?

Which brings us back to Jim's question: Why did it happen and how?
Well, for years, researchers have *pondered* this question of cat domestication, and the best I can do here is just a theory, but tell me it doesn't make sense.

In evolutionary terms, early settlements and agriculture in the *Fertile Crescent* around 10,000 years ago created a completely new environment for any wild animals that were flexible and curious enough to exploit it. Mice were attracted to these settlements, and cats, being *obligate* *carnivores* they must eat meat to thrive. They were almost certainly drawn to the settlements by the mice. Over time, only the cats that could adapt to living in human-dominated environments would have stayed and thrived. People probably encouraged them to stick around and controlled the mice in the field and the *granaries*, and eventually, their homes, and perhaps simply grew to like their company too.

Student:
Hmm...so in a way, the difference with cats was that domestication was their idea instead of ours.

But why do you suppose only one of the five subspecies was domesticated? Were the others just not friendly enough towards humans?

Professor:
Well, no. In fact, at least two of the other subspecies are known to be relatively friendly, but the Fertile Crescent subspecies had, well, a *head start* because of its proximity to the first human settlements. And as agriculture spread, the tamed ancestors of this subspecies spread with it. So they fill the niche of home companion in each region they entered and effectively shut out the local subspecies that were already there.

Why does the professor point out that most cats are solitary hunters?
- To provide one reason that cats might seem unlikely animals to be domesticated
- To give an example of a characteristic that developed relatively recently in the evolutionary history of cats
- To explain why wild dogs were generally more successful at hunting than cats
- To explain why cats evolved into many unique subspecies
Right : A	Chose : A


#### TPO_037_L003_Q003
According to the professor, what do many ancient Egyptian paintings reveal about cats?
- Cats in ancient Egypt were in the early stages of domestication.
- Cats were welcome as companions in the homes of ancient Egyptians.
- Many different breeds of cats existed in ancient Egypt.
- Ancient Egyptian cats did not closely resemble any of the five subspecies of wildcat.
Right : B	Chose : B


#### TPO_037_L003_Q004
Why do researchers believe that the cat’s grave and the human’s grave on the island of Cyprus provide evidence of early cat domestication?
- Both graves contained a collar, scraps of food, and a bowl.
- The cat’s body and the human’s body were positioned to face in the same direction when they were buried.
- The box in which the cat was buried and the box in which the human was buried were similarly decorated.
- The cat’s body and the human’s body were apparently buried at the same time.
Right : BD	Chose :  BD


#### TPO_037_L003_Q005
Why does the professor mention that the wildcat subspecies of the Fertile Crescent lived close to the first human settlements?
- To explain why that subspecies developed an unfriendly disposition
- To explain why that subspecies was the only one that evolved a relatively small skeletal frame
- To explain why that subspecies was the only one to be domesticated
- To explain why members of that subspecies became obligate carnivores
Right : C	Chose : A

What can be inferred about the professor when she says this:
- She wants the students to tell her which aspects of the theory are not clear.
- She wants to know whether anyone has already heard the theory.
- She expects that the students will agree with her that the theory seems reasonable.
- She is critical of researchers who have oversimplified a complex question.
Right : C	Chose : C
