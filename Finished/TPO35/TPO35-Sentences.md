In the second clause of the sentence, the subject follows the verb due to a construction known as subject-verb inversion, which is often used for emphasis or stylistic reasons.

### Why Use Inversion?

1. **Emphasis:** The inverted structure emphasizes "particularly noteworthy," highlighting the importance or surprising nature of the statement.
2. **Stylistic Choice:** This form can create a smoother or more sophisticated flow, especially in written or formal contexts.
