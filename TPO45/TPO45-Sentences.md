In **"as far as possible"**, the phrase modifies the verb "go" by describing the extent or distance.
- **As**: A conjunction introducing comparison or extent.
- **Far**: An adverb indicating distance.
- **As possible**: The second part of the comparison, indicating the greatest possible extent.

Both phrases are used to indicate a maximum degree or extent within a comparative framework, typically involving an implied standard.
