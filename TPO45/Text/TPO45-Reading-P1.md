### The Beringia Landscape
During the peak of the last ice age, northeast Asia (Siberia) and Alaska were connected by a broad land mass called the Bering Land Bridge. This land bridge existed because so much of Earth's water was frozen in the great ice sheets that sea levels were over 100 meters lower than they are today. Between 25,000 and 10,000 years ago, Siberia, the Bering Land Bridge, and Alaska shared many environmental characteristics. These included a common mammalian fauna of large mammals, a common flora composed of broad grasslands as well as *wind-swept* *dunes* and tundra, and a common climate with cold, dry winters and *somewhat* warmer summers. The recognition that many aspects of the modern flora and fauna were present on both sides of the Bering Sea as *remnants* of the ice-age landscape led to this region being named Beringia.

It is through Beringia that small groups of large mammal hunters, slowly expanding their hunting territories, eventually colonized North and South America. On this archaeologists generally agree, but that is where the agreement stops. One broad area of disagreement in explaining the *peopling* of the Americas is the *domain* of paleoecologists, but it is critical to understanding human history: what was Beringia like?

The Beringian landscape was very different from what it is today. Broad, windswept valleys; glaciated mountains; sparse vegetation; and less moisture created a rather *forbidding* land mass. This land mass supported herds of now-extinct species of mammoth, bison, and horse and somewhat modern versions of caribou, musk ox, *elk*, and saiga *antelope*. These grazers supported in turn a number of impressive carnivores, including the giant short-faced bear, the *saber*-tooth cat, and a large species of lion. 

The presence of mammal species that require grassland vegetation has led Arctic biologist Dale Guthrie to argue that while cold and dry, there must have been broad areas of dense vegetation to support herds of mammoth, horse, and bison. Further, nearly all of the ice-age fauna had teeth that indicate an adaptation to *grasses and sedges*; they could not have been supported by a modern flora of *mosses and lichens*. Guthrie has also demonstrated that the landscape must have been subject to intense and continuous winds, especially in winter. He makes this argument based on the anatomy of horse and bison, which do not have the ability to search for food through deep snow cover. They need landscapes with strong winds that remove the winter snows, exposing the dry grasses beneath. Guthrie applied the term "mammoth steppe" to characterize this landscape.

In contrast, Paul Colinvaux has offered a *counterargument* based on the analysis of *pollen* in lake sediments dating to the last ice age. He found that the amount of pollen recovered in these sediments is so low that the Beringian landscape during the peak of the last glaciation was more likely to have been what he termed a "polar desert," with little or only sparse vegetation.In no way was it possible that this region could have supported large herds of mammals and thus, human hunters. Guthrie has argued against this view by pointing out that radiocarbon analysis of mammoth, horse, and bison bones from Beringian deposits revealed that the bones date to the period of most intense glaciation.

The argument seemed to be at a *standstill* until a number of recent studies resulted in a spectacular *suite* of new finds. The first was the discovery of a 1,000-square-kilometer preserved *patch* of Beringian vegetation dating to just over 17,000 years ago-the peak of the last ice age. The plants were preserved under a thick ash fall from a volcanic eruption. Investigations of the plants found grasses, sedges, mosses, and many other varieties in a nearly continuous cover, as was predicted by Guthrie. But this vegetation had a thin root mat with no soil formation, demonstrating that there was little long-term stability in plant cover, a finding supporting some of the arguments of Colinvaux. A mixture of continuous but thin vegetation supporting herds of large mammals is one that seems *plausible* and realistic with the available data.

Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.
- According to biologist Dale Guthrie, mammal species require broad areas of vegetation to survive.
- Dale Guthrie is an Arctic biologist who argued that broad areas of dense vegetation were surely enough to attract mammals such as mammoth, horse, and bison to Beringia.
- Dale Guthrie argued that Beringia, though cold and dry, must have had enough dense vegetation to support the herds of mammoth, horse, and bison that lived there.
- As long as Beringia was cold and dry, argued Dale Guthrie, dense vegetation grew in order to support the herds of mammoth, horse, and bison—the mammal species present there.

During the last ice age, human hunters pursued large mammals across Beringia, a land whose climatic characteristics have been in dispute.
- Strong evidence indicates that large mammals like mammoth and bison survived in the harsh ice-age Beringian landscape.
- Beringian mammals crossed easily from northeastern Asia to Alaska across the Bering Land Bridge, though there are indications that they usually went back to Asia for the brief, but warm, summers.
- Carnivores such as the saber-tooth cat were primarily responsible for the disappearance of the largest of the grazing animals, but the harsh winters caused some grazers to die of starvation.
- Analyses of ice-age sediments uncovered very small amounts of pollen, suggesting that Beringia lacked the quantity of vegetation needed to support large herds of mammals.
- The discovery that grasses, sedges, and mosses survived under the thick ash from a large volcanic eruption proved that the ice-age Beringian plant cover was extremely resistant to climatic extremes.
- Recent discoveries suggest that shallow-rooted plants created a fairly continuous cover over ice-age Beringia, though the cover most likely was variable and uncertain in any one location.
