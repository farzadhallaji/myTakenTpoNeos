Narrator 
Listen to a conversation between a student and an employee at the university center for *off-campus* study. 

Student 
Hi. I am Tom Arnold. I am supposed to pick up a packet from the regional center for marine research. I am doing an internship there this summer. 

Employee 
Yes. I have it right here. The mail carrier dropped it off a few minutes ago. 

Student 
Thanks. Um…I wanted to ask about getting credits for the internship. I don’t know if… 

Employee 
I might be able to help you with that. Is there a problem? 

Student 
I just wanted to make sure the details have been corrected. The system should show that I am registered to earn four credits. But as of Friday, nothing was showing up yet. I was told it would be fixed this morning. 

Employee 
Well, I can check on the computer for you. Tom Arnold, right? 

Student 
Yes. 

Employee 
Well, it is showing credits…but only three. 

Student 
Really?! So now what? These all have to be finalized last week. 

Employee 
Well, yes. The course enrollment period ended last week. But since our office was supposed to get this *straightened out* for you before then… Let me see what I can do. 

Uh…did the university give approval for you to earn four credits for this internship? Because the other students at the center for marine research are only getting three.
 
Student 
Um…I am pretty sure those other students are doing the internship at the center’s aquarium, taking classes in marine biology and then teaching visitors about the various *displays*. I am doing a special research internship with the center. We’ll be collecting data on changes to the seafloor out in the open ocean. 

Employee 
Oh. That sounds quite advanced. 

Student 
Well, the internship requires me to have *scuba diving* certification and to be a senior oceanography student. I want to do advanced study in oceanography when I graduate. So I really want to get a sense of what real research is like. 

Employee 
I see. Now let’s try and see if we can… Oh. OK. I see the problem. There are two kinds of internships listed here—regular and research. Yours is listed as regular so it is only showing three credits. 

Student 
Can you switch it? 

Employee 
Not yet. But it lists Professor Leonard as… 

Student 
She is in charge of all the internships. 

Employee 
She just needs to send an email so I have an official record. Then I can switch it. And that should solve everything. 

Student 
Great! And I know Professor Leonard is in her office this afternoon, so I can go there later. It will be such a relief to get all these paperwork completed.
