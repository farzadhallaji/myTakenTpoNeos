# Integrated Writing: Example on Cane Toads in Australia

## Introduction:
1. The reading and lecture discuss the spread of **cane toads** in Australia.
2. The reading states that cane toads were introduced to protect farmers but now pose a threat to native animals. Three measures are proposed to stop their spread.
3. However, the lecturer rejects these measures, casting doubt on all the proposals.

---

## Body Paragraph 1:
1. **Reading:** Proposes building a national fence to stop the cane toads from spreading.
   - The fence would block the toads' movement into uncolonized areas.
2. **Lecture:** Counters this, explaining that young cane toads and eggs can easily pass through water bodies (rivers/streams), rendering the fence ineffective.

---

## Body Paragraph 2:
1. **Reading:** Suggests volunteers can catch and destroy the toads.
   - Cane toads can be caught in traps or by hand, especially young toads and eggs found in water.
2. **Lecture:** Argues that volunteers might mistakenly capture native frogs, which are very similar to young cane toads, potentially causing environmental harm.

---

## Body Paragraph 3:
1. **Reading:** Proposes using a disease-causing virus to control the population.
   - The virus would infect the cane toads without harming other species.
2. **Lecture:** Challenges this, stating that infected toads might be transported to Central and South America, harming the native cane toad populations and disrupting the ecosystem.
