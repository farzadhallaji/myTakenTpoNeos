*Question 1:**

1. When the inquiry _________ its investigation, it will publish a report.

- **A. completed**
- **B. will complete**
- **C. has completed**

**Correct Answer:** C. *has completed*

**Explanation:**

- **Option C (has completed)** is correct because it uses <u>the present perfect tense to indicate that the action of completing the investigation will be finished before the future action of publishing the report</u>. In time clauses introduced by "when," we use the present perfect to refer to an action that will be completed in the future.

- **Option A (completed)** is incorrect because it uses the simple past tense "completed," which refers to an action that happened in the past. However, the main clause "it will publish a report" is in the future tense, so the tenses do not match.

- **Option B (will complete)** is incorrect because we do not use "will" in time clauses introduced by words like "when." Instead, we use the present simple or present perfect tense to refer to future events in time clauses.

**Question 2:**

2. You can park _______ you like in this street.

- **A. as though**
- **B. what**
- **C. wherever**

**Correct Answer:** C. *wherever*

**Explanation:**

- **Option C (wherever)** is correct because "wherever" means "anywhere," fitting the sentence to express that you can park at any place you like on the street.

- **Option A (as though)** is incorrect because "as though" means "as if" and is used to introduce hypothetical situations, not locations.

- **Option B (what)** is incorrect because "what" does not fit grammatically in this context. "What" is used for objects or things, not places.

---

**Question 3:**

3. _______ he spent in intensive care, he was not allowed visitors.

- **A. During the time**
- **B. Immediately**
- **C. While**

**Correct Answer:** A. *During the time*

**Explanation:**

- **Option A (During the time)** is correct because it properly introduces a period during which something happened. It sets the time frame for the main clause.

- **Option B (Immediately)** is incorrect because "immediately" refers to something happening right after another event, which doesn't make sense in this context.

- **Option C (While)** is less preferred here because "While he spent in intensive care" is less idiomatic. Normally, we would say "While he was in intensive care." Since that is not an option, "During the time" is the better choice.

---

**Question 4:**

4. The tests differ _______ they measure potential performance and aptitude.

- **A. as if**
- **B. like**
- **C. in the way**

**Correct Answer:** C. *in the way*

**Explanation:**

- **Option C (in the way)** is correct because it means "the manner in which," fitting the sentence to explain how the tests differ.

- **Option A (as if)** is incorrect because "as if" introduces a hypothetical or unreal situation, which doesn't fit here.

- **Option B (like)** is incorrect because "like" should be followed by a noun or pronoun, not a clause starting with "they measure."

---

**Question 5:**

5. We’ve been living in temporary accommodation _______ we moved here in September.

- **A. while**
- **B. since**
- **C. when**

**Correct Answer:** B. *since*

**Explanation:**

- **Option B (since)** is correct because "since" indicates the starting point of a period up to the present, which matches the present perfect continuous tense "have been living."

- **Option A (while)** is incorrect because "while" indicates a duration of time during which something happens, but doesn't specify the starting point.

- **Option C (when)** is incorrect because "when" does not connect the two clauses in a way that indicates a continuing action from a specific time in the past.

---

**Question 6:**

6. We can find you a ticket for _______ you want to go.

- **A. just as**
- **B. as soon as**
- **C. anywhere**

**Correct Answer:** C. *anywhere*

**Explanation:**

- **Option C (anywhere)** is correct because it means "any place," fitting the sentence to express that a ticket can be found for any destination.

- **Option A (just as)** is incorrect because "just as" is used to indicate that two things happen at the same time, not for places.

- **Option B (as soon as)** is incorrect because it refers to time, not location, and does not fit grammatically in this sentence.

---

**Question 7:**

7. The technicians replaced the safety mechanism _______ they had been instructed.

- **A. as**
- **B. whenever**
- **C. while**

**Correct Answer:** A. *as*

**Explanation:**

- **Option A (as)** is correct because it means "in the manner that," indicating the technicians followed instructions.

- **Option B (whenever)** is incorrect because it refers to any time an action occurs, which doesn't fit the context of following specific instructions.

- **Option C (while)** is incorrect because "while" refers to two actions happening simultaneously, which is not the intended meaning here.

---

**Question 8:**

8. We’ll let you know _______ you need to come for your interview.

- **A. anywhere**
- **B. when exactly**
- **C. just as**

**Correct Answer:** B. *when exactly*

**Explanation:**

- **Option B (when exactly)** is correct because it specifies the exact time the person needs to come for the interview.

- **Option A (anywhere)** is incorrect because it refers to a place, not time.

- **Option C (just as)** is incorrect because it implies simultaneity or manner, not specifying a time.

---

**Question 9:**

9. Give me a call as soon as you _______ at the airport.

- **A. arrive**
- **B. arrived**
- **C. will arrive**

**Correct Answer:** A. *arrive*

**Explanation:**

- **Option A (arrive)** is correct because, in time clauses introduced by "as soon as," we use the present simple tense to refer to future events.

- **Option B (arrived)** is incorrect because it is past tense, but the action is in the future.

- **Option C (will arrive)** is incorrect because we do not use "will" in time clauses with "as soon as."

---

**Question 10:**

10. A bell will ring three times five minutes _______ the library closes.

- **A. before**
- **B. until**
- **C. as soon as**

**Correct Answer:** A. *before*

**Explanation:**

- **Option A (before)** is correct because it indicates that the bell will ring five minutes prior to the library closing.

- **Option B (until)** is incorrect because "until" means up to the time of an event, which doesn't fit the time frame described.

- **Option C (as soon as)** is incorrect because "as soon as" refers to something happening immediately after another event, and "five minutes as soon as" does not make sense.
____
**Question:**

Fill in the blanks in the passage using the options provided:

Options: after, while, whenever, once

---

(1) ______ construction begins in South Court, the Student Centre will remain open on its regular schedule. The cafeteria will be usable (2) ______ the first phase of work is taking place, but will be closed from June 30th. (3) ______ this work has been completed, the cafeteria will reopen. This is scheduled for November 1st. While access to the Student Centre from North Road is closed, use the fire exit at the rear of the building. This will be kept open (4) ______ this occurs and warning signs will be placed outside.

---

**Answers and Explanations:**

---

**Blank (1):** **Once**

- **Explanation:** "Once construction begins in South Court, the Student Centre will remain open on its regular schedule."

  - **"Once"** is used to indicate that something will happen immediately after another event occurs. It fits here to show that even after construction starts, the Student Centre will continue its operations.

---

**Blank (2):** **While**

- **Explanation:** "The cafeteria will be usable **while** the first phase of work is taking place, but will be closed from June 30th."

  - **"While"** is appropriate here because it means "during the time that," indicating that the cafeteria remains usable during the first phase of work.

---

**Blank (3):** **After**

- **Explanation:** "**After** this work has been completed, the cafeteria will reopen. This is scheduled for November 1st."

  - **"After"** is correct because it shows that the reopening of the cafeteria will occur following the completion of the work.

---

**Blank (4):** **Whenever**

- **Explanation:** "This will be kept open **whenever** this occurs and warning signs will be placed outside."

  - **"Whenever"** means "every time that," suggesting that the fire exit will be kept open every time access from North Road is closed.

---

**Final Filled Passage:**
(1) **Once** construction begins in South Court, the Student Centre will remain open on its regular schedule. The cafeteria will be usable (2) **while** the first phase of work is taking place, but will be closed from June 30th. (3) **After** this work has been completed, the cafeteria will reopen. This is scheduled for November 1st. While access to the Student Centre from North Road is closed, use the fire exit at the rear of the building. This will be kept open (4) **whenever** this occurs and warning signs will be placed outside.

---
**Explanation of Incorrect Options:**

- **For Blank (1):**
  - **"After"** is less appropriate because it would imply the Student Centre was closed before construction began.
  - **"While"** doesn't fit well because "while construction begins" is not idiomatic.
  - **"Whenever"** suggests multiple occurrences, but construction begins only once.

- **For Blank (2):**
  - **"After"** doesn't make sense because the cafeteria is usable during, not after, the first phase.
  - **"Once"** implies immediacy after an event, which doesn't fit the context.
  - **"Whenever"** suggests any time the first phase happens, but it is a specific, continuous period.

- **For Blank (3):**
  - **"Once"** could also fit here, but since "after" is available and fits well, and "once" is better used in Blank (1), "after" is the best choice.
  - **"Whenever"** <span style="background:#40a9ff">is inappropriate because the completion is a single, scheduled event.</span>

- **For Blank (4):**
  - **"After"** is incorrect because it doesn't make sense to keep the exit open after the event occurs.
  - **"While"** has already been used and isn't available again.
  - **"Once"** isn't suitable because it doesn't convey repeated occurrences.
___
In English, the tense used in time clauses depends on whether we are referring to the future, the present, or the past. Here's a breakdown to clarify when to use the present tense in time clauses and when it's appropriate to use other tenses.

---

**Time Clauses Referring to Future Events:**

When a time clause refers to a future event, we typically use the **present simple** or **present perfect** tense in the time clause, even though the main clause is in the future tense. This is a common feature of English grammar to avoid using "will" or "shall" in subordinate clauses of time.

- **Examples:**
  - Correct: "I will call you **when I arrive**."
  - Incorrect: "I will call you **when I will arrive**."
  - Correct: "She will start cooking **after she finishes** her work."
  - Incorrect: "She will start cooking **after she will finish** her work."
  - Correct: "We'll begin the meeting **as soon as everyone has arrived**."
  
In these examples, the time clauses ("when I arrive," "after she finishes," "as soon as everyone has arrived") use the present simple or present perfect tense to refer to future actions.

---

**Time Clauses Referring to Past Events:**

When the time clause refers to past events, we use past tenses in both the main clause and the time clause. This is because both actions occurred in the past.

- **Examples:**
  - "When the tomb **was discovered**, the archaeologists **were** astounded."
  - "After the operation **had started**, it **could not** be interrupted."
  - "Once the match **finished**, there **was** a huge cheer."
  - "They fitted the windows, but not the way we **wanted** them to be fitted."

In these sentences, both the main clause and the time clause are in the past tense (simple past or past perfect), as they describe events that have already occurred.

---

**Answering Your Question:**

So, **yes**, there is a need to use present tense in time clauses **when referring to future events**. However, when the time clause refers to past events, we use past tenses accordingly.

- **For Future Events:**
  - Use present tenses in time clauses.
  - **Example:** "I'll wait here until you **come** back."

- **For Past Events:**
  - Use past tenses in time clauses.
  - **Example:** "She cried when she **heard** the news."

---

**Why Don't We Use "Will" in Future Time Clauses?**

In English, it's a grammatical rule that we do not use "will" or "shall" in time clauses, even if the action is in the future. Instead, we use the present simple or present perfect tense.

- **Incorrect:** "I will start cooking when you **will arrive**."
- **Correct:** "I will start cooking when you **arrive**."

---

**Summary:**

- **Present Tense in Time Clauses:** Used when the time clause refers to a future event.
- **Past Tense in Time Clauses:** Used when the time clause refers to a past event.
- **No "Will" in Time Clauses:** Avoid using "will" or "shall" in time clauses; use the present tense instead.

---

**Examples from Our Previous Exercise:**

- **Sentence 2:** "The moment the match **finished**, there **was** a huge cheer."
  - Both clauses are in the past tense because the event happened in the past.

- **Sentence 9:** "It sounds as if they **are not telling** the truth."
  - The main clause is present ("sounds"), and the time clause is present continuous ("are not telling"), because it refers to an ongoing situation.

---

**Conclusion:**

<span style="background:#fdbfff">The use of present tense in time clauses is necessary when referring to future events to maintain correct grammatical structure. For past events, past tenses are appropriate. Understanding this distinction helps ensure clarity and correctness in your writing and speech.</span>
