# Grammar Overview: Reported Clauses, Subjunctive Mood, and Reporting Questions

This overview explains important rules for constructing **reported clauses**, focusing on tense consistency, the **subjunctive mood**, and **reporting questions**.

---

## 1. Reported Clauses

### Definition

**Reported clauses** are used to indirectly convey what someone has said, thought, or proposed. They often begin with the conjunction **"that"** and serve as the object of the reporting verb.

### Allowed Tenses

- **Main Clause in Past Tense:**
  - When the main (reporting) clause is in the **past tense**, the verb in the reported clause usually shifts to the past tense to maintain tense consistency.
  - **Example:**
    - *"I realized that excessive exercise **was** harmful."*
- **Universal Truths:**
  - For facts or universal truths that remain constant, the present tense can be retained in the reported clause, even if the main clause is in the past tense.
  - **Example:**
    - *"I realized that exercise **is** beneficial for health."*

### Not Allowed Tenses

- **Avoid Unnecessary Tense Shifts:**
  - Do not use progressive or perfect tenses unnecessarily, especially if they create grammatical inconsistencies.
  - **Incorrect Example:**
    - *"I realized that excessive exercise **is being** harmful."*

---

## 2. Subjunctive Mood

### Definition

The **subjunctive mood** expresses wishes, demands, suggestions, or recommendations after certain verbs like **propose**, **insist**, **demand**, **recommend**, and **suggest**.

### Allowed Forms

- **Base Form of the Verb:**
  - Use the base form of the verb (infinitive without "to") after the conjunction **"that"**.
  - **Example:**
    - *"She proposed that we **stay** at her uncle’s farmhouse."*
- **Use of "Should" (Especially in British English):**
  - Including **"should"** before the base form is acceptable, particularly in British English.
  - **Example:**
    - *"She proposed that we **should stay** at her uncle’s farmhouse."*

### Not Allowed Forms

- **Avoid Past Tense After Subjunctive Verbs:**
  - Do not use the past tense form after verbs that require the subjunctive mood, as it implies an action already completed rather than a suggestion or command.
  - **Incorrect Example:**
    - *"She proposed that we **stayed** at her uncle’s farmhouse."*

---

## 3. Reported Questions

### Definition

**Reported questions** convey what someone asked without quoting their exact words. They transform direct questions into statement form and often begin with **"if"** or **"whether"** for yes/no questions.

### Allowed Forms

- **Using "If" or "Whether" for Yes/No Questions:**
  - Introduce reported yes/no questions with **"if"** or **"whether"**.
  - **Examples:**
    - *"He asked **if** the chalet was free."*
    - *"He asked **whether** the chalet was free."*

### Not Allowed Forms

- **Avoid "If or Not":**
  - Do not use **"if or not"** when presenting alternatives; instead, use **"whether or not"**.
  - **Incorrect Example:**
    - *"He asked **if or not** the chalet was free."*
  - **Correct Example:**
    - *"He asked **whether or not** the chalet was free."*

---

## 4. Tense Consistency

### Past Tense Reporting Verbs

- **Shift Reported Clause to Past Tense:**
  - When the reporting verb is in the past tense, the verb in the reported clause typically shifts to the past tense to maintain consistency.
  - **Example:**
    - *"She said that she **would** come the next day."*  
      *(Direct speech: "I **will** come tomorrow.")*

### Present or Future Tense Reporting Verbs

- **Maintain Original Tense in Reported Clause:**
  - If the reporting verb is in the present or future tense, the verb in the reported clause usually stays in its original tense.
  - **Example:**
    - *"He says that he **will** call later."*

---

By following these guidelines, you can construct grammatically correct reported clauses that accurately reflect the original statements while maintaining proper tense consistency and mood.

___

**Set 1:**

- **Sentence A:** *They asked whether or not she intended to emigrate.*
  - **Incorrect.** The phrase "whether or not" is redundant here. "Whether" alone implies the two possibilities, so "or not" is unnecessary.
- **Sentence B:** *They asked if she intended to emigrate.*
  - **Correct.** Using "if" in indirect questions is acceptable and grammatically correct.
- **Sentence C:** *They asked that she inform them of her decision about emigrating.*
  - **Correct.** This sentence correctly uses the subjunctive mood after "asked that" to express a request.

---

**Set 2:**

- **Sentence A:** *We knew that the Earth was not at the center of the universe.*
  - **Incorrect.** Using "was" suggests that the Earth might now be at the center, which is illogical. For universal truths, the present tense "is" should be used even after a past-tense verb.
- **Sentence B:** *We knew that the Earth is not at the center of the universe.*
  - **Correct.** Retaining the present tense "is" for a universal truth is appropriate.
- **Sentence C:** *We know the Earth is not at the center of the universe.*
  - **Correct.** Present tense is correctly used throughout for a universal truth.

---

**Set 3:**

- **Sentence A:** *The lawyer advised that he should be open with his partners.*
  - **Correct.** It's acceptable to use "should" after "advised that" to express a recommendation.
- **Sentence B:** *The lawyer advised that he was open with his partners.*
  - **Incorrect.** This implies the lawyer informed someone that he (the lawyer) was already open, which likely changes the intended meaning.
- **Sentence C:** *The lawyer advised that he be open with his partners.*
  - **Correct.** This uses the subjunctive mood appropriately after "advised that" to suggest a course of action.

---

**Set 4:**

- **Sentence A:** *I haven’t heard if I have to go or stay.*
  - **Incorrect.** "Whether" should be used instead of "if" when presenting alternatives: "I haven't heard whether I have to go or stay."
- **Sentence B:** *I’ve just heard that I have to go.*
  - **Correct.** The sentence is grammatically correct and clearly conveys the information.
- **Sentence C:** *I’ve yet to hear whether I can stay.*
  - **Correct.** "Whether" is correctly used to indicate the two possibilities.

---

**Set 5:**

- **Sentence A:** *The football coach insisted that the players follow a strict diet.*
  - **Correct.** This uses the subjunctive mood properly after "insisted that" to express a demand.
- **Sentence B:** *The football coach insisted that the players followed a strict diet.*
  - **Correct.** If the coach is asserting that the players already followed the diet, this sentence is appropriate.
- **Sentence C:** *The football coach insisted that the players must follow a strict diet.*
  - **Incorrect.** "Insisted" and "must" both express necessity, making "must" redundant here. It's better to say "insisted that the players follow a strict diet."

---

**Summary:**

- **Set 1 Correct Sentences:** B, C
- **Set 2 Correct Sentences:** B, C
- **Set 3 Correct Sentences:** A, C
- **Set 4 Correct Sentences:** B, C
- **Set 5 Correct Sentences:** A, B

Each correct sentence follows proper grammatical rules regarding verb tense, mood, and the use of conjunctions like "if" and "whether." Incorrect sentences either contain redundancies, improper tense usage, or misused conjunctions that alter the intended meaning.

Here are the answers to your questions:

1. **He demanded that the board of directors ________.**

   **Answer:** A. **resign**

   **Explanation:** After verbs like "demand," the subjunctive mood is used, and the verb in the subordinate clause takes the base form without "to." So, "He demanded that the board of directors **resign**."

2. **The zoo-keeper told her that not all snakes ________ deadly.**

   **Answer:** A. **are**

   **Explanation:** "Not all snakes are deadly" is a universal truth. Even though the reporting verb is in the past tense ("told"), the present tense "are" is used in the reported clause for universal facts. So, "The zoo-keeper told her that not all snakes **are** deadly."

3. **Let Rachel decide for herself ________ she wants to stand for the post of president.**

   **Answer:** A. **if**

   **Explanation:** "If" is used to introduce indirect yes/no questions or to express uncertainty. So, "Let Rachel decide for herself **if** she wants to stand for the post of president."

4. **We’re wondering if ________ see your new baby.**

   **Answer:** B. **we may**

   **Explanation:** In indirect questions, the subject precedes the verb. So, "We're wondering if **we may** see your new baby."

5. **The members of the team ________ they lack practice.**

   **Answer:** A. **feel**

   **Explanation:** "Members" is a plural noun, so it takes the plural verb "feel." So, "The members of the team **feel** they lack practice."

6. **The old man claimed that he ________ once fought a bear single-handedly.**

   **Answer:** A. **had**

   **Explanation:** When reporting a past action that occurred before another past action, the past perfect tense "had" is used. So, "The old man claimed that he **had** once fought a bear single-handedly."

7. **I suggest that the documents ________ shredded.**

   **Answer:** B. **be**

   **Explanation:** After verbs like "suggest," the subjunctive mood requires the base form of the verb. So, "I suggest that the documents **be** shredded."

8. **She has to decide ________ she’s taking arts or science courses.**

   **Answer:** B. **whether**

   **Explanation:** "Whether" is used when presenting alternatives. So, "She has to decide **whether** she's taking arts or science courses."

9. **In 1994, he said ________ complete his thesis in a year.**

   **Answer:** A. **he would**

   **Explanation:** When the reporting verb is in the past tense ("said"), "will" shifts to "would" in the reported clause. So, "In 1994, he said **he would** complete his thesis in a year."

10. **They’re trying to guess whether________ real.**

    **Answer:** B. **those diamonds are**

    **Explanation:** In indirect questions, the subject precedes the verb. So, "They're trying to guess whether **those diamonds are** real."

By applying the rules of reported speech, subjunctive mood, and tense consistency, these answers reflect correct grammatical usage.

____

1. They're speculating whether will the market recover soon. 

   They're speculating whether the market will recover soon. 

2. All his friends reminded him that the future was unpredictable.     

3.  I suggest that your sister takes a long holiday.

4. You must find out if have you been immunized.     

5.  The millionaire agree that riches didn’t guarantee happiness.     

6.  We inquired if could we fly direct to Atlanta.

___

All his friends reminded him that the future is unpredictable.

I suggest that your sister **take** a long holiday.

You must find out if you have been immunized.

The millionaire agreed that riches don't guarantee happiness.

We inquired if we could fly direct to Atlanta.

___

The reason we use **"take"** instead of **"takes"** in the sentence **"I suggest that your sister take a long holiday."** is because of the **subjunctive mood** in English grammar.

### **Explanation:**

- **Subjunctive Mood:** The subjunctive mood is used to express wishes, suggestions, demands, or hypothetical situations. It often follows certain verbs like **suggest**, **recommend**, **insist**, **demand**, and **propose**.

- **Base Form of the Verb:** In the subjunctive mood, the verb that follows **"that"** uses the base form (infinitive without "to") of the verb, regardless of the subject.

- **Third-Person Singular Exception:** Normally, in the present indicative mood, a third-person singular subject (like **"your sister"**) would take a verb ending in **"-s"** (e.g., **"takes"**). However, in the subjunctive mood, we do **not** add **"-s"** to the base form.

### **Correct Usage:**

- **Subjunctive Mood:**  
  - *"I suggest that your sister **take** a long holiday."*  
    - **"take"** is the base form of the verb used in the subjunctive mood after **"suggest that"**.

### **Incorrect Usage:**

- **Indicative Mood (Not Appropriate Here):**  
  - *"I suggest that your sister **takes** a long holiday."*  
    - **"takes"** is the third-person singular form used in the indicative mood, which is not appropriate after verbs that require the subjunctive.

### **Additional Examples:**

- **Using Subjunctive Mood:**
  - *"They recommend that he **study** harder."*
  - *"The teacher insists that each student **be** punctual."*
  - *"It is essential that she **remain** calm."*

- **Common Verbs That Trigger the Subjunctive:**
  - **advise, ask, demand, insist, propose, recommend, request, suggest, urge**

### **Summary:**

- Use the **base form** of the verb after verbs that require the subjunctive mood.
- Do **not** add **"-s"**, **"-es"**, or **"-ed"** to the verb, even if the subject is third-person singular.
- This rule helps convey that the action is a suggestion, demand, or hypothetical situation, not a statement of fact.

### **Conclusion:**

So, **"I suggest that your sister take a long holiday."** is grammatically correct because it properly uses the subjunctive mood to express a recommendation. Using **"takes"** would incorrectly apply the indicative mood, which doesn't fit in this context.
