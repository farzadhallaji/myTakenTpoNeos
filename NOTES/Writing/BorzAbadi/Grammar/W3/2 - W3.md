Below are the correct options for each question, along with explanations for why they are correct and why the other options are incorrect.

---

**1. The personnel officer will show you which cubicle ______ you been allocated.**

- **Correct Option:** **B. you have**

- **Explanation:**
  - **Option B** is correct because in an embedded question (a question within a statement), the subject and verb are not inverted. The proper word order is subject ("you") followed by the auxiliary verb ("have"), forming "you have been allocated."
  - **Option A** ("have you") incorrectly inverts the subject and auxiliary verb, which is appropriate only in direct questions, not in embedded questions within statements.

---

**2. Richard doesn’t know ______ his company will be sending him to France.**

- **Correct Option:** **A. when**

- **Explanation:**
  - **Option A** is correct because "when" appropriately introduces a time-related subordinate clause, fitting the context of not knowing the time of the event.
  - **Option B** ("what") is incorrect because it suggests uncertainty about the object being sent to France, which doesn't logically fit with "him" as the direct object.

---

**3. You won’t believe ______ car is parked next to ours.**

- **Correct Option:** **B. whose**

- **Explanation:**
  - **Option B** is correct because "whose" is the possessive form of "who," used to ask or tell about ownership. It correctly refers to the owner of the car.
  - **Option A** ("who's") is a contraction of "who is" or "who has," which doesn't make sense in this context ("You won't believe who is car...").

---

**4. I understand ______ you sometimes shun company.**

- **Correct Option:** **B. why**

- **Explanation:**
  - **Option B** is correct because "why" introduces a reason or explanation, fitting the context of understanding the reasons behind shunning company.
  - **Option A** ("how") refers to the manner or method, which is less appropriate here since the sentence is about understanding reasons, not methods.

---

**5. Of the two strategies, we can tell you ______ is better.**

- **Correct Option:** **A. which**

- **Explanation:**
  - **Option A** is correct because "which" is sufficient to refer back to "the two strategies" without redundancy.
  - **Option B** ("which strategy") is unnecessary repetition since "strategies" have already been mentioned.

---

**6. He described what ______ as vividly as possible to the police officer.**

- **Correct Option:** **B. he saw**

- **Explanation:**
  - **Option B** is correct because in reported speech or embedded clauses, the subject ("he") comes before the verb ("saw"), maintaining normal declarative sentence structure.
  - **Option A** ("did he see") improperly uses the interrogative form, which is not appropriate in this declarative context.

---

**7. She found a slipper and realized ______ it must be.**

- **Correct Option:** **A. whose**

- **Explanation:**
  - **Option A** is correct because "whose" acts as a possessive pronoun referring to the owner of the slipper.
  - **Option B** ("whose one") is redundant and ungrammatical because "whose" already implies possession, and adding "one" is unnecessary.

---

**8. Ian hasn’t decided ______ route he will take, the inland or the coastal one.**

- **Correct Option:** **B. which**

- **Explanation:**
  - **Option B** is correct because "which" is used when selecting from a known set of options, fitting the context of choosing between the inland or coastal routes.
  - **Option A** ("what") is less specific and typically used when the options are not known, making it inappropriate here.

---

**9. Her memoirs will reveal ______ been financing her plays.**

- **Correct Option:** **A. who's**

- **Explanation:**
  - **Option A** is correct because "who's" is the contraction of "who has," fitting the present perfect tense "who has been financing."
  - **Option B** ("whose") is possessive and doesn't make sense in this context because it would incorrectly suggest ownership over "been financing."

---

**10. We can’t imagine how ______ all these years.**

- **Correct Option:** **A. the old man coped**

- **Explanation:**
  - **Option A** is correct because in an indirect statement, the clause should follow normal subject-verb order ("the old man coped").
  - **Option B** ("did the old man cope") incorrectly uses question word order, which is not appropriate in this declarative sentence.

---

**Summary of Correct Options:**

1. **B. you have**
2. **A. when**
3. **B. whose**
4. **B. why**
5. **A. which**
6. **B. he saw**
7. **A. whose**
8. **B. which**
9. **A. who's**
10. **A. the old man coped**

---

**General Tips:**

- **Embedded Questions:** In indirect questions or embedded clauses, use the normal subject-verb order, not the inverted order used in direct questions.
- **"Whose" vs. "Who's":** "Whose" is possessive; "who's" is a contraction of "who is" or "who has."
- **"Which" vs. "What":** Use "which" when referring to a specific set of known options; use "what" when the options are unknown or unlimited.
- **Avoid Redundancy:** Do not repeat words unnecessarily if the meaning is clear without them.

Sure! Let's go through each sentence one by one, determine whether it's correct or incorrect, and explain why.

---

### **1. Kelvin has always done what seems right and fair to him.**

**A. Correct**

**Explanation:**

This sentence is **correct**. It uses the relative pronoun "what" to introduce a noun clause ("what seems right and fair to him") that functions as the object of the verb "done." The sentence is grammatically sound and conveys a clear meaning.

---

### **2. This cardigan’s not mine. I wonder whose one it is.**

**B. Incorrect**

**Explanation:**

The sentence is **incorrect** because the word "one" is unnecessary and unidiomatic in this context. The correct way to express this is:

- *"I wonder whose it is."*

Alternatively, you could specify the noun:

- *"I wonder whose cardigan it is."*

---

### **3. The reporter wouldn’t disclose who had given him the story.**

**A. Correct**

**Explanation:**

This sentence is **correct**. The clause "who had given him the story" functions as the direct object of the verb "disclose." The sentence structure is appropriate for an indirect statement.

---

### **4. Their expressions don’t indicate which of the three accounts they believe.**

**A. Correct**

**Explanation:**

---

### **6. He needs to recommend who’s banking privileges should be increased.**

**B. Incorrect**

- *"He needs to recommend whose banking privileges should be increased."*

---

### **7. They demanded to know why had their petition been ignored.**

---

### **9. Of the two scenarios, I can’t say which one is more attractive.**

---

### **10. Now I recall where did I first see that tattoo.**
